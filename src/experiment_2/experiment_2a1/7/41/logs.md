Background: You are a expert at Operations Research and Linear Programming and Python. Based on description you solve given problem using Pulp python library. Python code place between ```python and ```. You receive the data in json format between: <DATA></DATA>. Do not change data format! Do not use `while` loop in python code! Do not include 'pip install' in script. Assume every python package is installed Print at the end the objective between <OBJ></OBJ> `print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')`

### ROLE: Role.USER
<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

<DATA>
{'capacity': 3, 'size': [1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}</DATA>

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
```python
import pulp
import json

#### Input data in JSON format
data = {'capacity': 3, 'size': [1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}
capacity = data['capacity']
sizes = data['size']

#### Number of files
N = len(sizes)

#### Create the optimization problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("FloppyDiskPacking", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
#### x[i][j] = 1 if file i is placed on disk j, 0 otherwise
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("x", (range(N), range(N)), 0, 1, pulp.LpBinary)

#### Objective function: minimize number of disks used
problem += pulp.lpSum(x[i][j] for i in range(N) for j in range(N)), "Minimize_NofDisks"

#### Each file must be placed on exactly one disk
for i in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[i][j] for j in range(N)) == 1, f"File_{i+1}_Placement"

#### Capacity constraints for each disk
for j in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(sizes[i] * x[i][j] for i in range(N)) <= capacity, f"Capacity_Disk_{j+1}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract the results
n_disks = sum(1 for j in range(N) if pulp.value(pulp.lpSum(x[i][j] for i in range(N))) > 0)
whichdisk = [next(j for j in range(N) if pulp.value(x[i][j]) == 1) for i in range(N)]

#### Prepare output in JSON format
output = {
    "n_disks": n_disks,
    "whichdisk": whichdisk
}

#### Print the objective value
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
