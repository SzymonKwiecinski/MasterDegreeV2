PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- Consider a communication network consisting of \var{n} nodes.
- Nodes are conÂ­nected by communication links.
- A link allowing one-way transmission from node \var{i} to node \var{j} is described by an ordered pair (\var{i},\var{j}). 
- Let \var{A} be the set of all links. 
- We assume that each link (\var{i},\var{j}) \in \var{A} can carry up to \var{U_{i,j}} bits per second. 
- There is a positive cost \var{C_{i,j}} per bit transmitted along that link. 
- Each node \var{k} generates data, at the rate of \var{B_{k,l}} bits per second, that have to be transmitted to node \var{l}, either through a direct link (\var{k}, \var{l}) or by tracing a sequence of links. 
- We allow the data with the same origin and destination to be split and be transmitted along different paths.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "links": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "U": U_{i,j},
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "data": [
        {
            "source": k,
            "destination": l,
            "rate": B_{k,l}
        }
    ]
}


OBJECTIVE: Find paths along which all data reach their intended destinations, while minimizing the total cost. 



OUTPUT INFO:
- \var{total_cost} represents the total cost of all the paths
- \var{path_cost} represents the cost of the corresponding path
- \var{path_flow} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

#### Parse the data from JSON format
num_links = data['NumLinks']
links = [(data['StartNode'][i], data['EndNode'][i], data['Capacity'][i], data['Cost'][i]) for i in range(num_links)]
num_flow_reqs = data['NumFlowReqs']
flow_reqs = [(data['Source'][i], data['Destination'][i], data['DataRate'][i]) for i in range(num_flow_reqs)]

#### Create the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Cost", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Create decision variables for flow on each link
flow_vars = {}
for start, end, capacity, cost in links:
    flow_vars[(start, end)] = pulp.LpVariable(f"flow_{start}_{end}", lowBound=0, upBound=capacity)

#### Objective function: Minimize the total cost
problem += pulp.lpSum(flow_vars[(start, end)] * cost for start, end, capacity, cost in links), "Total_Cost"

#### Constraints for each flow request
for source, destination, rate in flow_reqs:
    #### Flow conservation: sum of inflow must equal sum of outflow
    inflow = pulp.lpSum(flow_vars[(start, end)] for start, end in links if end == destination)
    outflow = pulp.lpSum(flow_vars[(start, end)] for start, end in links if start == source)
    problem += inflow - outflow == 0, f"Flow_Conservation_{source}_{destination}"

    #### Ensure the data rate is met
    problem += outflow >= rate, f"Data_Rate_Constraint_{source}_{destination}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Collect optimized paths and costs
optimized_paths = []
total_cost = pulp.value(problem.objective)

for source, destination, rate in flow_reqs:
    route = []
    path_flow = 0
    path_cost = 0

    for start, end, capacity, cost in links:
        flow_value = flow_vars[(start, end)].varValue
        if flow_value > 0:
            route.append(start)
            path_flow += flow_value
            path_cost += flow_value * cost
