PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- Consider a communication network consisting of \var{n} nodes.
- Nodes are conÂ­nected by communication links.
- A link allowing one-way transmission from node \var{i} to node \var{j} is described by an ordered pair (\var{i},\var{j}). 
- Let \var{A} be the set of all links. 
- We assume that each link (\var{i},\var{j}) \in \var{A} can carry up to \var{U_{i,j}} bits per second. 
- There is a positive cost \var{C_{i,j}} per bit transmitted along that link. 
- Each node \var{k} generates data, at the rate of \var{B_{k,l}} bits per second, that have to be transmitted to node \var{l}, either through a direct link (\var{k}, \var{l}) or by tracing a sequence of links. 
- We allow the data with the same origin and destination to be split and be transmitted along different paths.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "links": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "U": U_{i,j},
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "data": [
        {
            "source": k,
            "destination": l,
            "rate": B_{k,l}
        }
    ]
}


OBJECTIVE: Find paths along which all data reach their intended destinations, while minimizing the total cost. 



OUTPUT INFO:
- \var{total_cost} represents the total cost of all the paths
- \var{path_cost} represents the cost of the corresponding path
- \var{path_flow} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

    "optimized_paths": {
        "paths": [

#### Input data

    'Source': [1, 2], 
    'Destination': [4, 3], 
    'DataRate': [40, 30]

#### Extract data from the input

flows = [(data['Source'][i], data['Destination'][i], data['DataRate'][i]) for i in range(data['NumFlowReqs'])]

#### Create a linear programming problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Communication_Cost", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Create decision variables for the flow on each link
flow_vars = {}

for (start, end, capacity, cost) in links:
    flow_vars[(start, end)] = pulp.LpVariable(f'flow_{start}_{end}', lowBound=0, upBound=capacity, cat='Continuous')

#### Objective function: Minimize total cost of the flow
problem += pulp.lpSum(flow_vars[(start, end)] * cost for (start, end, _, cost) in links), "Total_Cost"

#### Constraints for each flow requirement
for (src, dst, rate) in flows:
    #### Flow out of the source
    problem += pulp.lpSum(flow_vars.get((src, end), 0) for (_, end) in links if _ == src) - \
               pulp.lpSum(flow_vars.get((start, src), 0) for (start, _) in links if end == src) == rate, f"Flow_out_{src}"

    #### Flow into the destination
    problem += pulp.lpSum(flow_vars.get((start, dst), 0) for (start, _) in links if end == dst) - \
               pulp.lpSum(flow_vars.get((dst, end), 0) for (_, end) in links if _ == dst) == -rate, f"Flow_in_{dst}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Prepare the output

for (start, end) in flow_vars:
    flow_value = flow_vars[(start, end)].varValue

        path_cost = flow_value * next(cost for (s, e, _, cost) in links if s == start and e == end)
