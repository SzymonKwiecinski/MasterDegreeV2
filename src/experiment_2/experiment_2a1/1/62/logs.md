Background: You are a expert at Operations Research and Linear Programming and Python. Based on description you solve given problem using Pulp python library. Python code place between ```python and ```. You receive the data in json format between: <DATA></DATA>. Do not change data format! Do not use `while` loop in python code! Do not include 'pip install' in script. Assume every python package is installed Print at the end the objective between <OBJ></OBJ> `print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')`

<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A traveler based in \var{start_city} needs to visit \var{N} towns for business.
- The distance \var{distance_{i,j}} between city \var{i} and \var{j} is provided in miles and are symmetric, meaning the distance from city \var{i} to city \var{j} is the same as from city \var{j} to city \var{i}.
- The traveler must return to \var{start_city} after visiting all towns.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "distances": {
        city_i: {
            city_j: distance_{i, j},
            for j in 1, ..., N-1
        },
        for i in 1, ..., N
    },
    "start_city": start_city
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the shortest route that the traveler can take to visit all \var{N} towns and return to \var{start_city}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- The sequence of cities visited after \var{start_city} is \var{visit_order}.
- \var{total_distance} traveled on this optimal journey.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "visit_order": [city_n for n in 1, ..., N+1],
    "total_distance": total_distance
}

#### Create the linear program
problem = pulp.LpProblem("TSP", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("x", (range(N), range(N)), cat='Binary')

#### Objective function: Minimize the total distance
problem += pulp.lpSum(distances[i][j] * x[i][j] for i in range(N) for j in range(N) if i != j)

#### Constraints
for j in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[i][j] for i in range(N) if i != j) == 1  #### Each city j is entered once

for i in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[i][j] for j in range(N) if j != i) == 1  #### Each city i is exited once

#### Subtour elimination constraints
subtour_constraints = []

    for subset in combinations(range(N), s):
        problem += pulp.lpSum(x[i][j] for i in subset for j in subset if i != j) <= len(subset) - 1

#### Start city constraints
for j in range(N):
    if j != start_city:
        problem += x[start_city][j] == 1  #### Start from the starting city
        problem += x[j][start_city] == 0  #### Don't return to the start city immediately

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Retrieve the visit order
visit_order = [start_city]
current_city = start_city

while len(visit_order) < N:
    for j in range(N):
        if x[current_city][j].varValue == 1:

            current_city = j
            break

#### Return to the start city
visit_order.append(start_city)

#### Calculate total distance
total_distance = pulp.value(problem.objective)

#### Output preparation
output = {
