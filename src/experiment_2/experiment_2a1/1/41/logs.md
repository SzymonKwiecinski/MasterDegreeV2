Background: You are a expert at Operations Research and Linear Programming and Python. Based on description you solve given problem using Pulp python library. Python code place between ```python and ```. You receive the data in json format between: <DATA></DATA>. Do not change data format! Do not use `while` loop in python code! Do not include 'pip install' in script. Assume every python package is installed Print at the end the objective between <OBJ></OBJ> `print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')`

<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

```python

#### Input data
data = {'capacity': 3, 'size': [1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}

capacity = data['capacity']
sizes = data['size']
N = len(sizes)

#### Create the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("FloppyDiskPacking", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("disk", range(N), cat='Binary')
y = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("used_disk", range(N), cat='Binary')

#### Objective function: Minimize the number of disks used
problem += pulp.lpSum(y[d] for d in range(N)), "TotalDisksUsed"

#### Constraints
for j in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[j] for d in range(N) if j < d) <= (1 * y[j]), f"File_Allocation_{j}"

for d in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
        problem += x[j] <= y[d], f"Assign_File_{j}_to_Disk_{d}"

#### Capacity constraints
for d in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(sizes[j] * x[j] for j in range(N)) <= capacity * y[d], f"Capacity_Constraint_{d}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract the results
n_disks = int(pulp.value(problem.objective))
whichdisk = [0] * N

for d in range(N):
    if pulp.value(y[d]) == 1:
        for j in range(N):
            if pulp.value(x[j]) == 1:
                whichdisk[j] = d + 1  #### Disk numbers start from 1

#### Output the results
output = {
    "n_disks": n_disks,
    "whichdisk": whichdisk
}

print(json.dumps(output))
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
