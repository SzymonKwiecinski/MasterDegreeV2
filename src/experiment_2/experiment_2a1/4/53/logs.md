Background: You are a expert at Operations Research and Linear Programming and Python. Based on description you solve given problem using Pulp python library. Python code place between ```python and ```. You receive the data in json format between: <DATA></DATA>. Do not change data format! Do not use `while` loop in python code! Do not include 'pip install' in script. Assume every python package is installed Print at the end the objective between <OBJ></OBJ> `print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')`

PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
        for id in 1, ..., m
    ],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

```python

#### Input data
data = {'NumTerminals': 3, 'NumDestinations': 4, 'Cost': [[34, 49, 17, 26], [52, 64, 23, 14], [20, 28, 12, 17]], 'Demand': [65, 70, 50, 45], 'Supply': [150, 100, 100]}

#### Define the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("SoybeanTransportation", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Define variables
routes = [(k, l) for k in range(data['NumTerminals']) for l in range(data['NumDestinations'])]
amounts = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("amount", routes, lowBound=0)

#### Objective function: Minimize transportation cost
problem += pulp.lpSum(data['Cost'][k][l] * amounts[(k, l)] for k in range(data['NumTerminals']) for l in range(data['NumDestinations']))

#### Supply constraints
for k in range(data['NumTerminals']):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(amounts[(k, l)] for l in range(data['NumDestinations'])) <= data['Supply'][k], f"Supply_{k}"

#### Demand constraints
for l in range(data['NumDestinations']):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(amounts[(k, l)] for k in range(data['NumTerminals'])) >= data['Demand'][l], f"Demand_{l}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Prepare output
distribution = [{"from": k, "to": l, "amount": amounts[(k, l)].varValue} for k in range(data['NumTerminals']) for l in range(data['NumDestinations']) if amounts[(k, l)].varValue > 0]

total_cost = pulp.value(problem.objective)

#### Output results
output = {
    "distribution": distribution,
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

print(json.dumps(output, indent=4))
