Background: You are a expert at Operations Research and Linear Programming and Python. Based on description you solve given problem using Pulp python library. Python code place between ```python and ```. You receive the data in json format between: <DATA></DATA>. Do not change data format! Do not use `while` loop in python code! Do not include 'pip install' in script. Assume every python package is installed Print at the end the objective between <OBJ></OBJ> `print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')`

<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"benefit": [[benefit_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...,K],
	"communication": [[communication_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
	"cost": [[cost_{l, m} for m in 1,...,L] for l in 1,...,L],
}


OBJECTIVE: Where should each department be located so as to minimize overall yearly cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{islocated_{k, l}} represents whether department \var{k} is relocated at city \var{l}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "islocated": [[islocated_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...K],
}

K = len(data['benefit'])  #### Number of departments
L = len(data['benefit'][0])  #### Number of cities (including London)

#### Initialize the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Department_Location_Problem", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
islocated = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("islocated", (range(K), range(L)), cat='Binary')

#### Objective function: Minimize the total costs
total_cost = pulp.lpSum(
    data['communication'][k][j] * data['cost'][l][m] * islocated[k][l]

    data['benefit'][k][l] * islocated[k][l]

    for l in range(L)
)

problem += total_cost - total_benefit

#### Constraints: Limit the number of departments in each city to 3
for l in range(L):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(islocated[k][l] for k in range(K)) <= 3, f"Max_departments_in_city_{l}"

#### Each department must be located in exactly one city
for k in range(K):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(islocated[k][l] for l in range(L)) == 1, f"One_location_for_department_{k}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Output the results
