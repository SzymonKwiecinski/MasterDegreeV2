Background: You are a expert at Operations Research and Linear Programming and Python. Based on description you solve given problem using Pulp python library. Python code place between ```python and ```. You receive the data in json format between: <DATA></DATA>. Do not change data format! Do not use `while` loop in python code! Do not include 'pip install' in script. Assume every python package is installed Print at the end the objective between <OBJ></OBJ> `print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')`

<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A traveler based in \var{start_city} needs to visit \var{N} towns for business.
- The distance \var{distance_{i,j}} between city \var{i} and \var{j} is provided in miles and are symmetric, meaning the distance from city \var{i} to city \var{j} is the same as from city \var{j} to city \var{i}.
- The traveler must return to \var{start_city} after visiting all towns.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "distances": {
        city_i: {
            city_j: distance_{i, j},
            for j in 1, ..., N-1
        },
        for i in 1, ..., N
    },
    "start_city": start_city
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the shortest route that the traveler can take to visit all \var{N} towns and return to \var{start_city}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- The sequence of cities visited after \var{start_city} is \var{visit_order}.
- \var{total_distance} traveled on this optimal journey.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "visit_order": [city_n for n in 1, ..., N+1],
    "total_distance": total_distance
}

#### Input data
data = {'N': 6, 'Distances': [[0, 182, 70, 399, 56, 214], [182, 0, 255, 229, 132, 267], [70, 255, 0, 472, 127, 287], [399, 229, 472, 0, 356, 484], [56, 132, 127, 356, 0, 179], [214, 267, 287, 484, 179, 0]], 'StartCity': 0}
N = data['N']
distances = data['Distances']
start_city = data['StartCity']

#### Create the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Traveling_Salesman_Problem", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("x", ((i, j) for i in range(N) for j in range(N) if i != j), cat='Binary')

#### Objective function: minimize total distance
problem += pulp.lpSum(distances[i][j] * x[(i, j)] for i in range(N) for j in range(N) if i != j)

#### Constraints
#### Each city must be visited exactly once
for j in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[(i, j)] for i in range(N) if i != j) == 1
for i in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[(i, j)] for j in range(N) if i != j) == 1

#### Subtour elimination constraints
u = pulp.LpVariable.dicts('u', range(N), lowBound=0, cat='Integer')
for i in range(1, N):
    for j in range(1, N):
        if i != j:
            problem += u[i] - u[j] + (N - 1) * x[(i, j)] <= N - 2

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extracting the visit order and total distance
visit_order = [start_city]
current_city = start_city

while len(visit_order) < N + 1:
    for j in range(N):
        if j != current_city and pulp.value(x[(current_city, j)]) == 1:
            visit_order.append(j)
            current_city = j
            break

visit_order.append(start_city)  #### return to start city
total_distance = pulp.value(problem.objective)

#### Output
output = {
    "visit_order": visit_order,
    "total_distance": total_distance
}

print(output)
