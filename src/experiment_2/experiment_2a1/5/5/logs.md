PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- Consider a communication network consisting of \var{n} nodes.
- Nodes are conÂ­nected by communication links.
- A link allowing one-way transmission from node \var{i} to node \var{j} is described by an ordered pair (\var{i},\var{j}). 
- Let \var{A} be the set of all links. 
- We assume that each link (\var{i},\var{j}) \in \var{A} can carry up to \var{U_{i,j}} bits per second. 
- There is a positive cost \var{C_{i,j}} per bit transmitted along that link. 
- Each node \var{k} generates data, at the rate of \var{B_{k,l}} bits per second, that have to be transmitted to node \var{l}, either through a direct link (\var{k}, \var{l}) or by tracing a sequence of links. 
- We allow the data with the same origin and destination to be split and be transmitted along different paths.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "links": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "U": U_{i,j},
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "data": [
        {
            "source": k,
            "destination": l,
            "rate": B_{k,l}
        }
    ]
}


OBJECTIVE: Find paths along which all data reach their intended destinations, while minimizing the total cost. 



OUTPUT INFO:
- \var{total_cost} represents the total cost of all the paths
- \var{path_cost} represents the cost of the corresponding path
- \var{path_flow} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

#### Data in JSON format

#### Extract data for the problem
links = [(data['StartNode'][i], data['EndNode'][i], data['Capacity'][i], data['Cost'][i]) for i in range(data['NumLinks'])]
flows = [(data['Source'][i], data['Destination'][i], data['DataRate'][i]) for i in range(data['NumFlowReqs'])]

#### Create a LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Total_Cost", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables for flow on each link
flow_vars = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("Flow", [(start, end) for start, end, _, _ in links], 0)

#### Objective function: Minimize total cost
problem += pulp.lpSum(flow_vars[(start, end)] * cost for start, end, _, cost in links)

#### Constraints for flow capacity
for start, end, capacity, _ in links:
    problem += flow_vars[(start, end)] <= capacity

#### Flow conservation constraints for each source and destination
for source, destination, rate in flows:
    #### Outflow from source
    problem += pulp.lpSum(flow_vars[(source, end)] for start, end in links if start == source) == rate

    #### Inflow to destination
    problem += pulp.lpSum(flow_vars[(start, destination)] for start, end in links if end == destination) == rate

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Collect optimized paths and costs
optimized_paths = {"paths": [], "total_cost": pulp.value(problem.objective)}

            path_flow += flow_value
            path_cost += flow_value * next(cost for s, e, _, cost in links if s == start and e == end)
