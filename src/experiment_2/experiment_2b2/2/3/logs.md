<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- A state wants to plan its electricity capacity for the next \var{T} years. 
- The state has a forecast of \var{demand_t} megawatts, presumed accurate, of the demand for electricity during year \var{t}.
- The existing capacity, which is in oil-fired plants, that will not be retired and will be available during year \var{t}, is \var{oil_t}.
- There are two alternatives for expanding electric capacity: coalÂ­ fired or nuclear power plants.
- There is a capital cost of \var{coal_cost} per megawatt of coal-fired capacity that becomes operational at the beginning of year \var{t}.
- There is a capital cost of \var{nuke_cost} per megawatt of nuclear power capacity that becomes operational at the beginning of year \var{t}.
- For various political and safety reasons, it has been decided that no more than \var{max_nuke}% of the total capacity should ever be nuclear (\var{max_nuke} is a number between 0 and 100).
- Coal plants last for \var{coal_life} years, while nuclear plants last for \var{nuke_life} years.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "demand": [demand_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "oil_cap": [oil_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "coal_cost": coal_cost,
    "nuke_cost": nuke_cost,
    "max_nuke": max_nuke,
    "coal_life": coal_life,
    "nuke_life": nuke_life,
}


OBJECTIVE: What is the capacity expansion plan that results in the minimum cost?


OUTPUT INFO:

- the output should represent how much coal and nuclear capacity should be added in each year, and how much the total cost is.
- the output should be a dictionary with three keys: "coal_cap_added", "nuke_cap_added", and "total_cost".
- the value of "coal_cap_added" should be a list of the coal capacity added in each year.
- the value of "nuke_cap_added" should be a list of the nuclear capacity added in each year.
- the value of "total_cost" should be a single floating point number showing the total cost of the system.


OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "coal_cap_added": [coal_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "nuke_cap_added": [nuke_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "total_cost": total_cost,
}

#### Extract data

OilCap = data["OilCap"]
CoalCost = data["CoalCost"]
NukeCost = data["NukeCost"]
MaxNuke = data["MaxNuke"]
CoalLife = data["CoalLife"]

#### Define the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Electricity_Capacity_Planning", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
coal_capacity_added = [pulp.LpVariable(f'coal_capacity_added_{t}', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous') for t in range(T)]
nuke_capacity_added = [pulp.LpVariable(f'nuke_capacity_added_{t}', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous') for t in range(T)]

#### Total capacity for each year
total_capacity = [pulp.LpVariable(f'total_capacity_{t}', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous') for t in range(T)]

#### Objective function: Minimize total cost
total_cost = pulp.lpSum(CoalCost * coal_capacity_added[t] + NukeCost * nuke_capacity_added[t] for t in range(T))
problem += total_cost, "Total_Cost"

#### Constraints
for t in range(T):
    #### Total capacity available
    coal_contrib = pulp.lpSum(coal_capacity_added[i] for i in range(max(0, t - CoalLife + 1), t + 1))
    nuke_contrib = pulp.lpSum(nuke_capacity_added[i] for i in range(max(0, t - NukeLife + 1), t + 1))
    problem += total_capacity[t] == OilCap[t] + coal_contrib + nuke_contrib

    #### Demand satisfaction
    problem += total_capacity[t] >= Demand[t]

    #### Nuclear capacity constraint
    problem += nuke_contrib <= (MaxNuke / 100) * total_capacity[t]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Output the results
coal_cap_added_result = [pulp.value(coal_capacity_added[t]) for t in range(T)]
