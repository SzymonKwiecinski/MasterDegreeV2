<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "x_0": x_0,
    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,
    "T": T
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is max_t |a_t|. 

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "fuel_spend" contains the total fuel spent by the rocket

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "v": [v_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "a": [a_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "fuel_spend": fuel_spent,

```python

data = {'X0': 0, 'V0': 0, 'XT': 1, 'VT': 0, 'T': 20}

#### Initialize problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Rocket_Thrust_Minimization", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Extract data
x_0, v_0, x_T, v_T, T = data['X0'], data['V0'], data['XT'], data['VT'], data['T']

#### Decision variables
x = [pulp.LpVariable(f"x_{t}", cat='Continuous') for t in range(T+1)]
v = [pulp.LpVariable(f"v_{t}", cat='Continuous') for t in range(T+1)]
a = [pulp.LpVariable(f"a_{t}", cat='Continuous') for t in range(T)]
delta = pulp.LpVariable("delta", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')

#### Initial conditions
problem += (x[0] == x_0)
problem += (v[0] == v_0)

#### Terminal conditions
problem += (x[T] == x_T)
problem += (v[T] == v_T)

#### System dynamics
for t in range(T):
    problem += (x[t+1] == x[t] + v[t])
    problem += (v[t+1] == v[t] + a[t])

#### Objective function
problem += delta

#### Constraints for minimizing the maximum absolute acceleration (thrust)
for t in range(T):
    problem += (a[t] <= delta)
    problem += (-a[t] <= delta)

#### Solve problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract results
positions = [pulp.value(x_t) for x_t in x]
velocities = [pulp.value(v_t) for v_t in v]
accelerations = [pulp.value(a_t) for a_t in a]
fuel_spent = sum(abs(pulp.value(a_t)) for a_t in a)

#### Output
output = {
    "x": positions,
    "v": velocities,
    "a": accelerations,
