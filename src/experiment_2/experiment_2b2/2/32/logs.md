Background: You are a expert at Operations Research and Linear Programming and Python. Based on description you solve given problem using Pulp python library. Python code place between ```python and ```. You receive the data in json format between: <DATA></DATA>. Do not change data format! Do not use `while` loop in python code! Do not include 'pip install' in script. Assume every python package is installed Print at the end the objective between <OBJ></OBJ> `print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')`

<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- We suppose that some products can be produced, each of them passing through several stages.
- Necessary time to produce 1 unit of product \var{k} is \var{produce_time_{k, s}} hours for stage \var{s}.
- Availability in working hours is \var{time_{s}} for stage \var{s}. 
- The unitary profits for product \var{k} is \var{profit_{k}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"produce_time": [[produce_time_{k, s} for s in 1,...,S] for k in 1,...,K],
	"available_time": [time_{s} for s in 1,...,S],
	"profit": [profit_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Determine the quantities to be produced such that all the production constraints are satisfied and the profit is maximized.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{quantity} represents the production quantity for each product

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"quantity": [quantity_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
```python
import pulp

#### Data from the problem
data = {'NumProducts': 2, 'NumMachines': 2, 'ProduceTime': [[1, 3], [2, 1]], 'AvailableTime': [200, 100], 'Profit': [20, 10]}

#### Unpack data
num_products = data['NumProducts']
num_machines = data['NumMachines']
produce_time = data['ProduceTime']
available_time = data['AvailableTime']
profit = data['Profit']

#### Define the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Maximize_Profit", pulp.LpMaximize)

#### Define decision variables
quantities = [pulp.LpVariable(f"quantity_{k}", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous') for k in range(num_products)]

#### Objective function
problem += pulp.lpSum(profit[k] * quantities[k] for k in range(num_products)), "Total_Profit"

#### Constraints for each machine
for s in range(num_machines):
    problem += (pulp.lpSum(produce_time[k][s] * quantities[k] for k in range(num_products)) <= available_time[s]), f"Time_Constraint_Stage_{s}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Retrieve results
output = {"quantity": [pulp.value(quantities[k]) for k in range(num_products)]}

#### Print results and objective value
print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
