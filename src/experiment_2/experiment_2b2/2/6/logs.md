<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "x_0": x_0,
    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,
    "T": T
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the total fuel \sum_{t=0}^{\var{T}-1} |\var{a_t}| spent subject to the preceding constraints.

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "fuel_spend" contains the total fuel spent by the rocket

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "v": [v_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "a": [a_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "fuel_spend": fuel_spent,
}

```python
import pulp

#### Parse the input data
data = {'InitialPosition': 0, 'InitialVelocity': 0, 'FinalPosition': 1, 'FinalVelocity': 0, 'TotalTime': 20}
x_0, v_0, x_T, v_T, T = data['InitialPosition'], data['InitialVelocity'], data['FinalPosition'], data['FinalVelocity'], data['TotalTime']

#### Create the LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("RocketControl", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Define the decision variables
x = [pulp.LpVariable(f"x_{t}", cat="Continuous") for t in range(T + 1)]
v = [pulp.LpVariable(f"v_{t}", cat="Continuous") for t in range(T + 1)]
a = [pulp.LpVariable(f"a_{t}", cat="Continuous") for t in range(T)]

abs_a = [pulp.LpVariable(f"abs_a_{t}", lowBound=0, cat="Continuous") for t in range(T)]

#### Set the objective function: Minimize total absolute fuel consumption
problem += pulp.lpSum(abs_a)

#### Add constraints
#### Initial conditions
problem += (x[0] == x_0)
problem += (v[0] == v_0)

#### Final conditions
problem += (x[T] == x_T)
problem += (v[T] == v_T)

#### Dynamic model constraints
for t in range(T):
    problem += (x[t + 1] == x[t] + v[t])
    problem += (v[t + 1] == v[t] + a[t])
    problem += abs_a[t] >= a[t]
    problem += abs_a[t] >= -a[t]

#### Solve the LP problem
problem.solve()

#### Retrieve the results
positions = [pulp.value(x_i) for x_i in x]
velocities = [pulp.value(v_i) for v_i in v]
accelerations = [pulp.value(a_i) for a_i in a]
fuel_spent = sum(abs(pulp.value(a_i)) for a_i in a)

#### Print results in the required output format
output = {
    "x": positions,
    "v": velocities,
    "a": accelerations,
    "fuel_spend": fuel_spent,
}
print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
