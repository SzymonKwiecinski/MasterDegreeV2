PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A firm produces \var{M} different goods using \var{N} different raw materials.
- The firm has \var{available_{i}} of raw material \var{i} available.
- Good \var{j} requires \var{req_{i,j}} units of material \var{i} per unit produced.
- Good \var{j} results in a revenue of \var{price_j} per unit produced.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "available": [available_{i} for i in 1, ..., N]
    "requirements": [[req_{i,j} for i in 1, ..., N] for j in 1, ..., M],
    "prices": [price_{j} for j in 1, ..., M]
}

OBJECTIVE: How much of each good should the firm produce in order to maximize its total revenue?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of each good produced \var{amount_{j}}.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "amount": [amount_{j} for j in 1, ..., M]
}

<DATA>
{'M': 4, 'N': 5, 'Available': [10, 20, 15, 35, 25], 'Requirements': [[3, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 5, 3], [0, 3, 1, 1, 5]], 'Prices': [7, 10, 5, 9]}</DATA>

To solve this problem, we need to create a linear programming model to maximize the revenue given the constraints on raw material usage. We will use the Pulp library in Python for this task.

Here's the Python code to solve the given problem:

```python
import pulp

#### Data from the JSON provided
data = {
    'M': 4,
    'N': 5,
    'Available': [10, 20, 15, 35, 25],
    'Requirements': [
        [3, 2, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 5, 2, 1, 0],
        [1, 0, 0, 5, 3],
        [0, 3, 1, 1, 5]
    ],
    'Prices': [7, 10, 5, 9]
}

#### Extract data
M = data['M']
N = data['N']
available = data['Available']
requirements = data['Requirements']
prices = data['Prices']

#### Initialize the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Maximize_Revenue", pulp.LpMaximize)

#### Decision variables: amount of each good produced
amount = [pulp.LpVariable(f'amount_{j+1}', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous') for j in range(M)]

#### Objective function: maximize total revenue
problem += pulp.lpSum([prices[j] * amount[j] for j in range(M)])

#### Constraints: do not exceed the available raw materials
for i in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum([requirements[j][i] * amount[j] for j in range(M)]) <= available[i]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Prepare the output format
output = {
    "amount": [pulp.value(amount[j]) for j in range(M)]
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This script first extracts the values of M (number of goods), N (number of raw materials), available raw materials, requirements, and prices from the provided data. It initializes a linear programming problem to maximize revenue, adds constraints corresponding to the available raw materials, and solves the problem. Finally, it prints the amount of each good produced and the total revenue objective value.
