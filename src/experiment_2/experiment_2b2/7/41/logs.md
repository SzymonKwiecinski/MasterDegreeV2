Background: You are a expert at Operations Research and Linear Programming and Python. Based on description you solve given problem using Pulp python library. Python code place between ```python and ```. You receive the data in json format between: <DATA></DATA>. Do not change data format! Do not use `while` loop in python code! Do not include 'pip install' in script. Assume every python package is installed Print at the end the objective between <OBJ></OBJ> `print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')`

### ROLE: Role.USER
<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
```python
import pulp

#### Data
data = {'capacity': 3, 'size': [1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}
capacity = data['capacity']
sizes = data['size']
N = len(sizes)

#### Problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Floppy_Distribution_Problem", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Variables
#### y[i] = 1 if disk i is used
y = [pulp.LpVariable(f'y_{i}', cat='Binary') for i in range(N)]

#### x[j][i] = 1 if file j is on disk i
x = [[pulp.LpVariable(f'x_{j}_{i}', cat='Binary') for i in range(N)] for j in range(N)]

#### Objective: Minimize the number of disks used
problem += pulp.lpSum(y), "Minimize_Disks_Used"

#### Constraints
#### Each file must be on exactly one disk
for j in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[j][i] for i in range(N)) == 1, f"File_{j}_on_One_Disk"

#### Capacity constraints for each disk
for i in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(sizes[j] * x[j][i] for j in range(N)) <= capacity * y[i], f"Capacity_Constraint_{i}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Results
n_disks = int(pulp.value(pulp.lpSum(y)))
whichdisk = [None] * N

for j in range(N):
    for i in range(N):
        if pulp.value(x[j][i]) == 1:
            whichdisk[j] = i

#### Output
output = {
    "n_disks": n_disks,
    "whichdisk": whichdisk
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
