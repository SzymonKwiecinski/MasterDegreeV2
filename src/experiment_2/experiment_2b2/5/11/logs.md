PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- A company must deliver \var{deliver_i} units of its product at the end of the \var{i}_th month.
- Material produced during a month can be delivered either at the end of the same month or can be stored as inventory and delivered at the end of a subsequent month.
- There is a storage cost of \var{storage_cost} dollars per month for each unit of product held in inventory. 
- The year begins with zero inventory. 
- If the company produces \var{x_i} units in month \var{i} and \var{x_{i+1}} units in month \var{i}+1, it incurs a cost of \var{switch_cost} |\var{x_{i+1}} - \var{x_i}|  dollars, reflecting the cost of switching to a new production level. 
- Assume that inventory left at the end of the year has no value and does not incur any storage cost.
- The company wants to minimize the total cost of the production and inventory schedule over the next \var{T} months.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "deliver": [deliver_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "storage_cost": storage_cost,
    "switch_cost": switch_cost,
}

OBJECTIVE: Minimize the total cost of the production and inventory schedule over the whole period.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{x_i} is the number of units produced in month \var{i}.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "cost": cost,
}

#### Extract data

#### Define the LP problem

problem += inventory[0] == x[0] - deliver[0]

#### Inventory Balance for each month
for i in range(1, T):
    problem += inventory[i] == inventory[i-1] + x[i] - deliver[i]

#### Constraints for switch cost (absolute difference)
for i in range(T-1):
    problem += switch[i] >= x[i+1] - x[i]
    problem += switch[i] >= x[i] - x[i+1]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Prepare output

```

In this corrected code, `lpAbs` is replaced with the use of auxiliary variables `switch` to represent the absolute differences, and constraints are added to ensure these variables correctly calculate the absolute differences needed for the switching cost.
