PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.

## START MESSAGE 4 
### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
The error you're encountering is due to attempting to multiply expressions directly in the computation of `total_communication_cost`. The constraints in Pulp need to be linear, and the issue arises from multiplying two decision variables `islocated[k, l] * islocated[j, m]`.

We need to manage the objective function computation linearly. One way to solve this is by introducing an auxiliary variable for each pair of departments and cities. This auxiliary variable will capture whether two departments are in particular cities and then use it in the communication cost computation.

We can resolve this issue by changing the approach for calculating `total_communication_cost`:

```python
import pulp

#### Data from the problem statement
data = {'benefit': [[10, 10], [15, 20], [10, 15], [20, 15], [5, 15]], 
        'communication': [[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.5, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 1.4, 1.2, 0.0], 
                          [1.0, 1.4, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0], [1.5, 1.2, 0.0, 2.0, 0.7], 
                          [0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 0.7, 0.0]], 
        'cost': [[5, 14, 13], [15, 5, 9], [13, 9, 10]]
       }

benefit = data["benefit"]
communication = data["communication"]
cost = data["cost"]

num_departments = len(benefit)
num_cities = len(benefit[0])

#### Problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Department_Location_Problem", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision Variables
islocated = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("islocated", 
                                  ((k, l) for k in range(num_departments) for l in range(num_cities)),
                                  cat='Binary')

#### Create an auxiliary variable for each pair of departments and cities
communication_cost_pairs = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("communication_cost_pairs", 
                                                 ((k, j, l, m) for k in range(num_departments)

#### Objective Function
total_benefit = sum(islocated[k, l] * benefit[k][l] for k in range(num_departments) for l in range(num_cities))
total_communication_cost = sum(communication_cost_pairs[k, j, l, m] * communication[k][j] * cost[l][m]
                               for k in range(num_departments) for j in range(num_departments)
                               for l in range(num_cities) for m in range(num_cities))
