<DESCRIPTION>

PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- Consider a set \var{P} described by linear inequality constraints, that is:
 \var{P} = {\var{x} \in R^\var{N} | \var{a_i}^T x <= \var{b_i} , i = 1, ..., m}.

where \var{a_i} \in R^\var{N} and \var{b_i} \in R

- A ball with center \var{y} in R^\var{N} and radius \var{r} is defined as the set of all points within (Euclidean) distance \var{r} from \var{y}.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "A": [[a_i_j for j in 1, ..., n] for i in 1, ..., m],
    "b": [b_i for i in 1, ..., m]
}

OBJECTIVE: We are interested in finding a ball with the largest possible radius, which is entirely contained within the set \var{P} (The center of such a ball is called the Chebychev center of \var{P}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- center (list): The center of the ball as a list of floats of length \var{N}
- radius (float): The radius of the ball as a float

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "center": [y_j for j in 1, ..., n],
    "radius": r
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
Based on the problem description, we are tasked with finding the Chebychev center of a polytope defined by a set of linear inequalities. This involves solving an optimization problem to maximize the radius \( r \) of a ball that can fit inside the polytope.

Let's implement the solution using the PuLP library:

```python
import pulp

#### Define the data
data = {
    "M": 4,
    "N": 2,
    "A": [[1.0, 0.0], [-1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, -1.0]],
    "B": [2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0]
}

#### Extract data
M = data["M"]
N = data["N"]
A = data["A"]
B = data["B"]

#### Define the LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Chebychev_Center", pulp.LpMaximize)

#### Define variables: center coordinates y_j and radius r
y = [pulp.LpVariable(f"y_{j}", lowBound=None, upBound=None, cat='Continuous') for j in range(N)]
r = pulp.LpVariable("r", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')

#### Objective: Maximize radius r
problem += r, "Objective: Maximize radius"

#### Constraints: Ensure the ball is within the polytope
for i in range(M):
    problem += pulp.lpSum([A[i][j] * y[j] for j in range(N)]) + r * (sum(A[i][j]**2 for j in range(N))**0.5) <= B[i], f"Constraint_{i}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract the results
center = [pulp.value(y_j) for y_j in y]
radius = pulp.value(r)

#### Print the results in the specified format
output = {
    "center": center,
    "radius": radius
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This script sets up and solves a linear programming problem to find the largest ball, centered at \( y \), that fits entirely within the polytope defined by the constraints given in matrix \( A \) and vector \( B \). The solution provides the center and radius of the largest such ball.
