PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a road divided into \var{N} segments that is illuminated by \var{M} lamps.
- Let \var{power_j} be the power of the \var{j}-th lamp. The illumination \var{ill_i} of the \var{i}-th segment is assumed to be \sum_{j=1}^{\var{M}} \var{coeff_{i,j}} \var{power_j}, where \var{coeff_{i,j}} are known coefficients.
- Let \var{desired_i} be the desired illumination of road \var{i}. 
- We are interested in choosing the lamp powers \var{power_j} so that the illuminations {ill_i} are close to the desired illuminations {desired_i}. 

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "coeff": [[coeff_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., M] for i in 1, ..., N],
    "desired": [desired_i for i in 1, ..., N]
}

OBJECTIVE: Find the lamp powers \var{power_j} that minimize the absolute error between the illuminations {ill_i} and the desired illuminations {desired_i}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{power_j} is the optimal power of the \var{j}-th lamp.
- \var{error} is the absolute error between the illuminations {ill_i} and the desired illuminations {desired_i}.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "power": [power_j for j in 1, ..., M]
    "error": error
}

#### Extracting data
data = {'N': 3, 'M': 2, 'Coefficients': [[0.5, 0.3], [0.2, 0.4], [0.1, 0.6]], 'DesiredIlluminations': [14, 3, 12]}
N = data['N']
M = data['M']
coefficients = data['Coefficients']
desired_illuminations = data['DesiredIlluminations']

#### Problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("LampPowerOptimization", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Variables
power_vars = [pulp.LpVariable(f'power_{j}', lowBound=0) for j in range(M)]
error_vars = [pulp.LpVariable(f'error_{i}', lowBound=0) for i in range(N)]

#### Objective: Minimize sum of absolute errors
problem += pulp.lpSum(error_vars)

#### Constraints for absolute error
for i in range(N):
    illumination = pulp.lpSum(coefficients[i][j] * power_vars[j] for j in range(M))
    problem += illumination - desired_illuminations[i] <= error_vars[i]
    problem += desired_illuminations[i] - illumination <= error_vars[i]

#### Solve
problem.solve()

#### Collecting results
power_values = [pulp.value(var) for var in power_vars]
total_error = sum(pulp.value(var) for var in error_vars)

#### Output
result = {
    "power": power_values,
    "error": total_error
}

print(result)
