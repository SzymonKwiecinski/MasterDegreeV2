PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A quantity y is known to depend on another quantity x. A set of corresponding values has been collected for x and y and is presented.
- The \var{k}-th y value takes \var{y_{k}} and the \var{k}-th x value takes \var{x_{k}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "y": [y_{k} for k = 1,...,K],
    "x": [x_{k} for k = 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Fit the ‘best’ straight line y = bx + a where the objective is to minimize the maximum deviation of all the observed values of y from the value predicted by the linear relationship.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{intercept} represents the intercept of the fitted line
- \var{slope} represents the slope of the fitted line

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}

## START MESSAGE 1 
### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we will use linear programming with the PuLP library in Python. The goal is to fit a line \( y = bx + a \) to the given data points such that the maximum deviation between the observed values and the predicted values is minimized. This is equivalent to minimizing the maximum absolute error (Chebyshev approximation) of the fit.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
import pulp

#### Input data
data = {'NumObs': 19, 'Y': [1.0, 0.9, 0.7, 1.5, 2.0, 2.4, 3.2, 2.0, 2.7, 3.5, 1.0, 4.0, 3.6, 2.7, 5.7, 4.6, 6.0, 6.8, 7.3], 'X': [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 1.9, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.6, 7.0, 7.6, 8.5, 9.0, 10.0]}

#### Define the LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Best_Fit_Line", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables for slope, intercept and maximum deviation
a = pulp.LpVariable('a', cat='Continuous')
b = pulp.LpVariable('b', cat='Continuous')
max_dev = pulp.LpVariable('max_dev', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')

#### The objective function: minimize the maximum deviation
problem += max_dev

#### Add constraints for each data point
for i in range(data['NumObs']):
    y_k = data['Y'][i]
    x_k = data['X'][i]
    #### deviation constraints
    problem += a + b * x_k - y_k <= max_dev
    problem += y_k - (a + b * x_k) <= max_dev

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Retrieve the results
intercept = pulp.value(a)
slope = pulp.value(b)

#### Output the results
output = {
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}

print(f" (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>")
print(output)
```

This code formulates the problem as a linear programming model, defining variables for the slope, intercept, and maximum deviation. It sets up constraints for each data point to ensure the model's objective of minimizing the maximum deviation. Finally, it solves the problem and outputs the best-fit line's slope and intercept, along with the objective value.
