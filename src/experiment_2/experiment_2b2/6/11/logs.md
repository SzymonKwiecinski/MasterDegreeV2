PROBLEM INFO: 
- A company must deliver \var{deliver_i} units of its product at the end of the \var{i}_th month.
- Material produced during a month can be delivered either at the end of the same month or can be stored as inventory and delivered at the end of a subsequent month.
- There is a storage cost of \var{storage_cost} dollars per month for each unit of product held in inventory. 
- The year begins with zero inventory. 
- If the company produces \var{x_i} units in month \var{i} and \var{x_{i+1}} units in month \var{i}+1, it incurs a cost of \var{switch_cost} |\var{x_{i+1}} - \var{x_i}|  dollars, reflecting the cost of switching to a new production level. 
- Assume that inventory left at the end of the year has no value and does not incur any storage cost.
- The company wants to minimize the total cost of the production and inventory schedule over the next \var{T} months.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "deliver": [deliver_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "storage_cost": storage_cost,
    "switch_cost": switch_cost,
}

OBJECTIVE: Minimize the total cost of the production and inventory schedule over the whole period.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{x_i} is the number of units produced in month \var{i}.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "cost": cost,

## START MESSAGE 4 
### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
The error indicates that `lpAbs` is not a valid function in the PuLP library. To handle absolute differences in linear programming, you can introduce auxiliary variables and constraints to model the absolute value. Let's fix the code accordingly:

```python
import pulp

#### Define the data
data = {'T': 12, 'Deliver': [100, 120, 110, 130, 150, 100, 90, 110, 95, 125, 130, 100], 'StorageCost': 5, 'SwitchCost': 10}

T = data['T']
deliver = data['Deliver']
storage_cost = data['StorageCost']
switch_cost = data['SwitchCost']

#### Create a linear programming problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Production_and_Storage_Costs", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
x = [pulp.LpVariable(f"x{i}", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous') for i in range(T)]
inventory = [pulp.LpVariable(f"inventory{i}", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous') for i in range(T)]
abs_diff = [pulp.LpVariable(f"abs_diff{i}", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous') for i in range(T-1)]

#### Objective function
problem += (pulp.lpSum(storage_cost * inventory[i] for i in range(T)) +
            pulp.lpSum(switch_cost * abs_diff[i] for i in range(T-1))), "Total Cost"

#### Constraints
problem += x[0] - deliver[0] == inventory[0], "Initial Inventory Constraint"
for i in range(1, T):
    problem += inventory[i-1] + x[i] - deliver[i] == inventory[i], f"Inventory Constraint Month {i+1}"

#### Add constraints for absolute differences
for i in range(T-1):
    problem += abs_diff[i] >= x[i+1] - x[i]
    problem += abs_diff[i] >= x[i] - x[i+1]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract the results
x_values = [pulp.value(x[i]) for i in range(T)]
total_cost = pulp.value(problem.objective)

#### Output the results
output = {"x": x_values, "cost": total_cost}
print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```
