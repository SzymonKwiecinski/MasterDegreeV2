PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- Consider a communication network consisting of \var{n} nodes.
- Nodes are conÂ­nected by communication links.
- A link allowing one-way transmission from node \var{i} to node \var{j} is described by an ordered pair (\var{i},\var{j}). 
- Let \var{A} be the set of all links. 
- We assume that each link (\var{i},\var{j}) \in \var{A} can carry up to \var{U_{i,j}} bits per second. 
- There is a positive cost \var{C_{i,j}} per bit transmitted along that link. 
- Each node \var{k} generates data, at the rate of \var{B_{k,l}} bits per second, that have to be transmitted to node \var{l}, either through a direct link (\var{k}, \var{l}) or by tracing a sequence of links. 
- We allow the data with the same origin and destination to be split and be transmitted along different paths.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "links": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "U": U_{i,j},
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "data": [
        {
            "source": k,
            "destination": l,
            "rate": B_{k,l}
        }
    ]
}


OBJECTIVE: Find paths along which all data reach their intended destinations, while minimizing the total cost. 



OUTPUT INFO:
- \var{total_cost} represents the total cost of all the paths
- \var{path_cost} represents the cost of the corresponding path
- \var{path_flow} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem with linear programming, we will model it using the PuLP library. We will define decision variables to determine how much data flows through each link and for each data flow request. The objective function will minimize the total cost associated with transmitting data over the network. Let's translate the problem description into a PuLP model:

```python
import pulp

#### Parse the input data
data = {
    'NumLinks': 4, 
    'StartNode': [1, 2, 2, 3], 
    'EndNode': [2, 3, 4, 4], 
    'Capacity': [50, 40, 60, 50], 
    'Cost': [2, 3, 1, 1], 
    'NumFlowReqs': 2, 
    'Source': [1, 2], 
    'Destination': [4, 3], 
    'DataRate': [40, 30]
}

#### Define nodes, links, and requirements
nodes = list(set(data['StartNode'] + data['EndNode']))
links = list(zip(data['StartNode'], data['EndNode']))
capacities = dict(zip(links, data['Capacity']))
costs = dict(zip(links, data['Cost']))
flow_requests = list(zip(data['Source'], data['Destination'], data['DataRate']))

#### Create the LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Network_Flow_Optimization", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Create decision variables for flow through each link for each data request
flow_vars = {}
for idx, (k, l, b) in enumerate(flow_requests):
    for (i, j) in links:
        flow_vars[(k, l, i, j)] = pulp.LpVariable(f"flow_{k}_{l}_{i}_{j}", lowBound=0, upBound=capacities[(i, j)])

#### Objective function: Minimize the total cost of transmitting data
problem += pulp.lpSum(flow_vars[(k, l, i, j)] * costs[(i, j)] for (k, l, _b) in flow_requests for (i, j) in links)

#### Constraints to ensure flow conservation
for (k, l, b) in flow_requests:
    for node in nodes:
        flow_in = pulp.lpSum(flow_vars[(k, l, i, node)] for (i, node) in links if i != node)
        flow_out = pulp.lpSum(flow_vars[(k, l, node, j)] for (node, j) in links if j != node)
        if node == k:  #### Source node
            problem += (flow_out - flow_in == b)
        elif node == l:  #### Destination node
            problem += (flow_in - flow_out == b)
        else:
            problem += (flow_in == flow_out)

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Gather the results
optimized_paths = {"paths": [], "total_cost": pulp.value(problem.objective)}

#### Extract paths and costs
for (k, l, _b) in flow_requests:
    path_flow = 0
    path_cost = 0
    route = []
    
    for (i, j) in links:
        if pulp.value(flow_vars[(k, l, i, j)]) > 0:
            path_flow += pulp.value(flow_vars[(k, l, i, j)])
            path_cost += pulp.value(flow_vars[(k, l, i, j)]) * costs[(i, j)]
            route.extend([i, j])
    
    if route:
        optimized_paths["paths"].append({
            "source": k,
            "destination": l,
            "route": list(dict.fromkeys(route)),  #### Remove duplicates in path
            "path_flow": path_flow,
            "path_cost": path_cost
        })

print(f'Optimized paths and costs: {optimized_paths}')
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This code sets up the linear programming problem using the given data, defines the flow conservation constraints, and solves the problem to find the optimal paths and associated costs. The results are displayed at the end.
