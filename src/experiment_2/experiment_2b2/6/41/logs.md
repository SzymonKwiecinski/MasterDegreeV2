<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

## START MESSAGE 1 
### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we will make use of the Pulp library to set up a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). The goal is to minimize the number of floppy disks used by optimally distributing the files onto the disks, without exceeding their capacity.

```python
import pulp

#### Read the data
data = {'capacity': 3, 'size': [1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}
capacity = data['capacity']
sizes = data['size']
N = len(sizes)

#### Create the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("MinimizeNumberOfFloppyDisks", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
#### x[i][j] = 1 if file j is on disk i; 0 otherwise
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("x", ((i, j) for i in range(N) for j in range(N)),
                          cat='Binary')

#### y[i] = 1 if disk i is used; 0 otherwise
y = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("y", (i for i in range(N)), cat='Binary')

#### Objective: Minimize the number of disks used
problem += pulp.lpSum([y[i] for i in range(N)])

#### Constraint: Each file must be assigned to exactly one disk
for j in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum([x[i, j] for i in range(N)]) == 1

#### Constraint: The total size of files on each disk cannot exceed the capacity
for i in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum([sizes[j] * x[i, j] for j in range(N)]) <= capacity * y[i]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract the solution
whichdisk = [-1] * N
for j in range(N):
    for i in range(N):
        if pulp.value(x[i, j]) == 1:
            whichdisk[j] = i

#### Calculate the total number of disks used
n_disks = sum(pulp.value(y[i]) for i in range(N))

#### Output result
result = {
    "n_disks": int(n_disks),
    "whichdisk": whichdisk
}

print(result)
#### Print objective value
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This code defines a MILP to minimize the number of disks used, introduces binary decision variables to indicate whether a file is placed on a particular disk, and solves the problem by satisfying the constraints. The solution is then extracted, and the total number of disks used and their allocation is printed as the result.
