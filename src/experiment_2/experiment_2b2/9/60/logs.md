PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A company has \var{I} projects to be done by consultants.
- They have a choice of \var{J} consultants.
- Each consultant may be assigned up to \var{K} projects. 
- Hiring consultant \var{j} incurs a fixed cost of \var{f_j}.
- Assigning project \var{i} to consultant \var{j} incurs an additional cost of \var{c_{i,j}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "fixed_costs": [f_j for j in 1, ..., J],
    "additional_costs": [[c_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., J] for i in 1, ..., I],
    "max_projects_per_consultant": K
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the assignment of consultants to projects that minimizes the total cost.

OUTPUT INFO:

- The projects assigned to each consultant \var{assignment_{j,i}}.
- \var{total_cost} reflects the total cost of hiring consultants and assigning them to projects.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "assignments": [[assignment_{j,i} for i in 1, ..., I] for j in 1, ..., J],
