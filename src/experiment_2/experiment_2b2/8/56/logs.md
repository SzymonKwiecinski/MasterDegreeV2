Background: You are a expert at Operations Research and Linear Programming and Python. Based on description you solve given problem using Pulp python library. Python code place between ```python and ```. You receive the data in json format between: <DATA></DATA>. Do not change data format! Do not use `while` loop in python code! Do not include 'pip install' in script. Assume every python package is installed Print at the end the objective between <OBJ></OBJ> `print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')`

<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
```python
import pulp
import json

#### Input data
data = {
    'west_time': [[3.5, 4.5], [4, 4], [5, 4]],
    'north_time': [[10, 10, 9], [9, 9, 12]]
}

#### Dimensions of the grid
N = len(data['north_time']) + 1
W = len(data['west_time'][0]) + 1

#### Create the LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Travel_Time", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
x_north = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("North", ((n, w) for n in range(1, N) for w in range(1, W)), cat='Binary')
x_west = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("West", ((n, w) for n in range(1, N + 1) for w in range(1, W)), cat='Binary')

#### Objective function
problem += (
    pulp.lpSum(data['north_time'][n-1][w-1] * x_north[n, w] for n in range(1, N) for w in range(1, W))
    + pulp.lpSum(data['west_time'][n-1][w-1] * x_west[n, w] for n in range(1, N + 1) for w in range(1, W))
)

#### Constraints
for n in range(1, N):
    for w in range(1, W):
        #### Flow balance at each interior intersection
        if n > 1 and w > 1:
            problem += (x_north[n-1, w] + x_west[n, w-1] == x_north[n, w] + x_west[n, w])

#### Ensure that we start at the initial position
problem += x_west[1, 1] == 1

#### Ensure that we reach the final position
problem += x_north[N-1, W-1] == 1

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Output results
paths = []
total_time = pulp.value(problem.objective)

for n in range(1, N):
    for w in range(1, W):
        if pulp.value(x_north[n, w]) == 1:
            paths.append((n, w))
        if pulp.value(x_west[n, w]) == 1:
            paths.append((n, w))

output = {
    "paths": paths,
    "total_time": total_time
}

print(json.dumps(output))
