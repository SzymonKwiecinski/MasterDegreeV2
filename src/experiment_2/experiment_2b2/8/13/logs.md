Background: You are a expert at Operations Research and Linear Programming and Python. Based on description you solve given problem using Pulp python library. Python code place between ```python and ```. You receive the data in json format between: <DATA></DATA>. Do not change data format! Do not use `while` loop in python code! Do not include 'pip install' in script. Assume every python package is installed Print at the end the objective between <OBJ></OBJ> `print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')`

PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- Consider a set \var{P} described by linear inequality constraints, that is:
 \var{P} = {\var{x} \in R^\var{N} | \var{a_i}^T x <= \var{b_i} , i = 1, ..., m}.

where \var{a_i} \in R^\var{N} and \var{b_i} \in R

- A ball with center \var{y} in R^\var{N} and radius \var{r} is defined as the set of all points within (Euclidean) distance \var{r} from \var{y}.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "A": [[a_i_j for j in 1, ..., n] for i in 1, ..., m],
    "b": [b_i for i in 1, ..., m]
}

OBJECTIVE: We are interested in finding a ball with the largest possible radius, which is entirely contained within the set \var{P} (The center of such a ball is called the Chebychev center of \var{P}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- center (list): The center of the ball as a list of floats of length \var{N}
- radius (float): The radius of the ball as a float

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "center": [y_j for j in 1, ..., n],
    "radius": r
}

#### Parse the data
data = {'M': 4, 'N': 2, 'A': [[1.0, 0.0], [-1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, -1.0]], 'B': [2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0]}
M = data['M']
N = data['N']
A = data['A']
B = data['B']

#### Initialize the LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Chebyshev_Center", pulp.LpMaximize)

#### Decision variables: y (center of the ball) and r (radius of the ball)
y = [pulp.LpVariable(f'y_{j}', lowBound=None) for j in range(N)]
r = pulp.LpVariable('r', lowBound=0)

#### Objective function: Maximize the radius r
problem += r, "Objective"

#### Adding constraints to the problem
for i in range(M):
    norm_ai = np.linalg.norm(A[i])  #### Compute the Euclidean norm of a_i
    problem += (pulp.lpDot(A[i], y) + norm_ai * r <= B[i]), f"Constraint_{i}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract solutions
center = [y[j].varValue for j in range(N)]
radius = r.varValue

#### Prepare the output in required format
output = {
    "center": center,
    "radius": radius
}

print(output)
print(f" (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>")
