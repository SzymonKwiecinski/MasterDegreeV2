<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem using the Pulp library, we can model it as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. We'll define binary variables to determine whether a floppy disk is used and assign files to disks such that the total number of disks used is minimized.

Here's the code solving the problem:

```python
from pulp import LpProblem, LpVariable, lpSum, LpMinimize
import pulp

#### Data from the problem
data = {'capacity': 3, 'size': [1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}

#### Extracting sizes and capacity
file_sizes = data['size']
capacity = data['capacity']
N = len(file_sizes)  #### Number of files
max_disks = N  #### The maximum number of disks needed, each file on a separate disk

#### Create the problem
problem = LpProblem("Minimize_Disks_Used", LpMinimize)

#### Variables
#### y[i] = 1 if disk i is used, 0 otherwise
y = LpVariable.dicts("DiskUsed", list(range(max_disks)), cat='Binary')

#### x[i][j] = 1 if file j is placed on disk i, 0 otherwise
x = LpVariable.dicts("FileOnDisk", (range(max_disks), range(N)), cat='Binary')

#### Objective
#### Minimize the number of disks used
problem += lpSum(y[i] for i in range(max_disks)), "TotalDisksUsed"

#### Constraints
#### Each file must be on exactly one disk
for j in range(N):
    problem += lpSum(x[i][j] for i in range(max_disks)) == 1, f"File_{j}_On_One_Disk"

#### The sum of the sizes of the files on each disk must not exceed the disk's capacity
for i in range(max_disks):
    problem += lpSum(x[i][j] * file_sizes[j] for j in range(N)) <= capacity * y[i], f"Capacity_Constraint_Disk_{i}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extracting results
n_disks = sum(y[i].varValue for i in range(max_disks))
whichdisk = [None] * N

for j in range(N):
    for i in range(max_disks):
        if x[i][j].varValue == 1:
            whichdisk[j] = i
            break

output = {
    "n_disks": int(n_disks),
    "whichdisk": whichdisk
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

In this solution:
- We define binary variables `y` to indicate whether a disk is used.
- Another set of binary variables `x` indicates which disk a file is stored on.
- The objective is to minimize the sum of `y` variables, representing used disks.
- There are constraints ensuring each file is on one disk and that the files on each disk do not exceed capacity.
- After solving, results are extracted to determine the number of disks used and the distribution of files among them.
