<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- An economy consists of several industries. 
- Each unit produced by one of the industries (a unit will be taken as £1’s worth of value of production) requires inputs from possibly its own industry as well as other industries. 
- Industry \var{k} requires \var{inputone_{k, j}} input from industy \var{j}.
- Industry \var{k} requires \var{manpowerone_{k}} units of manpower.
- There is a time lag in the economy so that the output in year t + 1 requires an input in year t.
- Output from an industry may also be used to build productive capacity for itself or other industries in future years.
- To give unit increases (capacity for £1’s worth of extra production) in productive capacity of industry \var{k}, \var{j} units of industry \var{inputtwo_{k, j}} and \var{manpowertwo{k}} units of manpower are needed.
- Input from an industry in year t results in a (permanent) increase in productive capacity in year t + 2.
- Stocks of goods may be held from year to year. 
- At present (year 0), the stocks of industry \var{k} is \var{stock_{k}}, and the capacity of industry \var{k} is \var{capacity_{k}}.
- An exogenous consumption requirement of \var{demand_{k}} units from industry \var{k} has to be satisfied in every year except year 0.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "inputone": [[inputone_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
    "manpowerone": [manpowerone_{k} for k in 1,...,K],

    "capacity": [capacity_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "demand": [demand_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Maximize the total manpower requirement over five years

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{produce} represents the amount of units produced by each industry in each year
- \var{buildcapa} represents the amount of units used to build productive capacity for each industry in each year
- \var{stockhold} represents the amount of stock of each industry held in each year

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we will use the PuLP library to optimize the total manpower requirement over five years. We need to set up the linear programming model according to the details provided. Here's the Python code that performs the optimization:

```python
import pulp

#### Data from JSON format
data = {
    "inputone": [[0.1, 0.1, 0.2], [0.5, 0.1, 0.1], [0.5, 0.2, 0.2]],
    "manpowerone": [0.6, 0.3, 0.2],
    "inputtwo": [[0.0, 0.1, 0.2], [0.7, 0.1, 0.1], [0.9, 0.2, 0.2]],
    "manpowertwo": [0.4, 0.2, 0.1],
    "stock": [150, 80, 100],
    "capacity": [300, 350, 280],
    "demand": [60000000.0, 60000000.0, 30000000.0]
}

#### Extracting values from data for convenience
inputone = data["inputone"]
manpowerone = data["manpowerone"]
inputtwo = data["inputtwo"]
manpowertwo = data["manpowertwo"]
stock = data["stock"]
capacity = data["capacity"]
demand = data["demand"]

K = len(inputone) #### Number of industries
T = 5 #### Number of years

#### Create LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Maximize_Manpower_Requirement", pulp.LpMaximize)

#### Decision variables
produce = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("produce", ((k, t) for k in range(K) for t in range(T)), lowBound=0, cat="Continuous")
buildcapa = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("buildcapa", ((k, t) for k in range(K) for t in range(T)), lowBound=0, cat="Continuous")
stockhold = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("stockhold", ((k, t) for k in range(K) for t in range(T)), lowBound=0, cat="Continuous")

#### Objective function: Maximize total manpower over 5 years
problem += pulp.lpSum(
    manpowerone[k] * produce[k, t] + manpowertwo[k] * buildcapa[k, t]
    for k in range(K) for t in range(T)
)

#### Constraints

#### Stock and capacity constraints for the first year
for k in range(K):
    problem += produce[k, 0] <= capacity[k]
    problem += stockhold[k, 0] == stock[k] + produce[k, 0] - buildcapa[k, 0]
    problem += stockhold[k, 0] <= stock[k]

#### Capacity and production constraints for subsequent years
for t in range(1, T):
    for k in range(K):
        #### Production cannot exceed capacity
        problem += produce[k, t] <= \
                   capacity[k] + pulp.lpSum(buildcapa[k, t - 2] for t - 2 in range(max(0, t - 2), t))
        #### Stock flow balance
        problem += stockhold[k, t] == stockhold[k, t - 1] + produce[k, t] - demand[k] - buildcapa[k, t]

#### Ensure non-negative stock holdings
for k in range(K):
    for t in range(T):
        problem += stockhold[k, t] >= 0

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Output results
output = {
    "produce": [[pulp.value(produce[k, t]) for t in range(T)] for k in range(K)],
    "buildcapa": [[pulp.value(buildcapa[k, t]) for t in range(T)] for k in range(K)],
    "stockhold": [[pulp.value(stockhold[k, t]) for t in range(T)] for k in range(K)]
}
