<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

## START MESSAGE 1 
### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem using the Pulp library, we will formulate it as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. Our goal is to minimize the number of floppy disks used to store the files without exceeding the disk capacity. We will create binary decision variables to track which files are placed on which disks and whether a disk is used.

Here's the Python code for the solution:

```python
import pulp

#### Input data
data = {'capacity': 3, 'size': [1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}
capacity = data['capacity']
sizes = data['size']
N = len(sizes)

#### Define the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Floppy_Disks", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Define decision variables
#### y[i] = 1 if disk i is used, 0 otherwise
y = [pulp.LpVariable(f'y_{i}', cat='Binary') for i in range(N)]

#### x[j][i] = 1 if file j is placed on disk i, 0 otherwise
x = [[pulp.LpVariable(f'x_{j}_{i}', cat='Binary') for i in range(N)] for j in range(N)]

#### Objective: Minimize the number of disks used
problem += pulp.lpSum(y)

#### Each file must be placed on exactly one disk
for j in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[j][i] for i in range(N)) == 1, f'FileAssignment_{j}'

#### Disk capacity constraints
for i in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[j][i] * sizes[j] for j in range(N)) <= capacity * y[i], f'DiskCapacity_{i}'

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract results
n_disks = sum(y[i].varValue for i in range(N))
whichdisk = [next(i for i in range(N) if x[j][i].varValue > 0.5) for j in range(N)]

#### Create output
output = {
    "n_disks": int(n_disks),
    "whichdisk": whichdisk
}

print(output)

print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This code sets up the MILP problem with decision variables to represent the choices of where to place each file and whether a disk is used. It then defines the objective to minimize the number of disks used and adds constraints to ensure each file is placed on exactly one disk and the total size of files on a disk does not exceed its capacity. Finally, it solves the problem and extracts the results.
