PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- An engineering factory makes several products on the machines, and the number of machine \var{m} the factory has is \var{num_{m}}.
- Each product \var{k} yields \var{profit_{k}} to profit (defined as £/unit selling price minus cost of raw materials).
- The unit production times (hours) product \var{k} requires on machine \var{m} is \var{time_{k, m}}
- In the present month (January) and several subsequent months, certain machines will be down for maintenance.
- In month \var{i}, the number of machine \var{m} that will be down is \var{maintain_{i, m}}.
- There are marketing limitations on each product in each month. 
- The limitation of product \var{k} in month \var{i} is \var{limit_{k, i}}.
- It is possible to store up to 100 of each product at a time at a cost of \var{store_price} per unit per month. 
- There are no stocks at present, but we should have a stock of \var{keep_quantity} of each type of product at the end of subsequent months.
- The factory works six days a week with \var{n_workhours} hours each day. 
- No sequencing problems need to be considered.
- We can assume that a month has 24 days for convenience.

OBJECTIVE: What selling, storing and manufacturing policy should the company pursue in order to maximize profit?

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
The error you're encountering suggests that we're trying to access an index in one of the lists that exceeds its bounds. The specific error indicates that the index `m` is out of range when accessing `data['time'][k][m]`. Let's take a closer look at this part of the code to make sure it correctly aligns with the sizes of the matrices given in the input.

To fix this, we'll ensure that the `time` data structure is correctly aligned with the machines. Let's also check that our loop indices correctly match the dimensions:
