<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A food is manufactured by refining raw oils and blending them together. 
- The raw oils are either vegetable oils or non-vegetable oils. 
- Each oil \var{i} may be purchased in month \var{m} for price \var{price_{i,m}}.
- The final product sells at \var{sell_price} per ton.
- Vegetable oils and non-vegetable oils require different production lines for refining. 
- In any month, it is not possible to refine more than \var{max_vegetable_refining_per_month} tons of vegetable oils and more than \var{max_non_vegetable_refining_per_month} tons of non-vegetable oils. 
- There is no loss of weight in the refining process, and the cost of refining may be ignored.
- It is possible to store up to \var{storage_size} tons of each raw oil for use later. 
- The cost of storage for both vegetable and non-vegetable oil is \var{storage_cost} per ton per month.
- The final product cannot be stored, nor can refined oils be stored.
- There is a technological restriction of hardness on the final product. 
- In the units in which hardness is measured, this must lie between \var{max_hardness} and \var{min_hardness}.
- The hardness product is computed by the weighted average of hardness of each oil.
- The hardness of oil \var{i} is \var{hardness_{i}}.
- At present, there are \var{init_amount} tons of each type of raw oil in storage. 
- We can assume that there is a month "0" to model the inital amount.
- It is required that at the end of the last month, we still have the same amout of storage as \var{init_amount}.
- This means directly adding the constraint that the storage in the last month must be equal to \var{init_amount}.
- The food may never be made up of more than three oils in any month.
- If an oil is used in a month, at least \var{min_usage} tons must be used.
- There are dependencies in the oil usage and \var{dependency_{i, j}} shows this relation
- If \var{dependency_{i, j}} is 1, then when oil \var{i} is used, oil \var{j} must also be used
