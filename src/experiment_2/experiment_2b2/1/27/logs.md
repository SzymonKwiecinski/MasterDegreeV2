<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"benefit": [[benefit_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...,K],
	"communication": [[communication_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
	"cost": [[cost_{l, m} for m in 1,...,L] for l in 1,...,L],
}


OBJECTIVE: Where should each department be located so as to minimize overall yearly cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{islocated_{k, l}} represents whether department \var{k} is relocated at city \var{l}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "islocated": [[islocated_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...K],
}

```python
import pulp

#### Parse the input data
data = {
    "benefit": [[10, 10], [15, 20], [10, 15], [20, 15], [5, 15]],
    "communication": [[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.5, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 1.4, 1.2, 0.0], [1.0, 1.4, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0], [1.5, 1.2, 0.0, 2.0, 0.7], [0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 0.7, 0.0]],
    "cost": [[5, 14, 13], [15, 5, 9], [13, 9, 10]]
}

benefit = data["benefit"]
communication = data["communication"]
cost = data["cost"]

num_departments = len(benefit)
num_cities = len(benefit[0])

#### Create a Linear Programming problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("DepartmentRelocation", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision Variables
islocated = [[pulp.LpVariable(f'islocated_{k}_{l}', cat='Binary') for l in range(num_cities)] for k in range(num_departments)]

#### Objective Function
objective = pulp.lpSum([
    -benefit[k][l] * islocated[k][l]
    + pulp.lpSum([
        communication[k][j] * cost[l][m] * islocated[j][m]
        for j in range(num_departments) for m in range(num_cities)
    ])
    for k in range(num_departments) for l in range(num_cities)
])

problem += objective

#### Constraints
#### Each department must be in exactly one city
for k in range(num_departments):
    problem += (pulp.lpSum([islocated[k][l] for l in range(num_cities)]) == 1)

#### No more than 3 departments in any city
for l in range(num_cities):
    problem += (pulp.lpSum([islocated[k][l] for k in range(num_departments)]) <= 3)

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Output the result
solution = {
    "islocated": [[int(pulp.value(islocated[k][l])) for l in range(num_cities)] for k in range(num_departments)],
}

print(solution)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This script uses the `pulp` Python library to solve the mixed integer linear programming problem described. It defines decision variables, sets up the objective function to minimize costs, and incorporates constraints that ensure each department is located in exactly one city and no city has more than three departments. The solution and objective value are printed at the end.
