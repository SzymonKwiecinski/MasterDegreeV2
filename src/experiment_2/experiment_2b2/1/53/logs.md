PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
        for id in 1, ..., m
    ],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve the given transportation problem, we will use the Pulp library to build and solve a linear programming model. The objective is to minimize the transportation cost of shipping soybeans from terminal cities to destination cities through port cities.

Let's define the problem in Pulp and find the optimal transportation plan.

```python
import pulp

#### Parse the input data
data = {'NumTerminals': 3, 'NumDestinations': 4, 'Cost': [[34, 49, 17, 26], [52, 64, 23, 14], [20, 28, 12, 17]], 'Demand': [65, 70, 50, 45], 'Supply': [150, 100, 100]}

#### Extract data
num_terminals = data['NumTerminals']
num_destinations = data['NumDestinations']
costs = data['Cost']
demands = data['Demand']
supplies = data['Supply']

#### Create the LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Transportation_Cost", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables: amount of soybeans shipped from terminal i to destination j
amount = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("Amount", ((i, j) for i in range(num_terminals) for j in range(num_destinations)), lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')

#### Objective function: Minimize the total transportation cost
problem += pulp.lpSum(costs[i][j] * amount[i, j] for i in range(num_terminals) for j in range(num_destinations))

#### Constraints to satisfy supply at each terminal
for i in range(num_terminals):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(amount[i, j] for j in range(num_destinations)) <= supplies[i], f"Supply_Constraint_Terminal_{i}"

#### Constraints to satisfy demand at each destination
for j in range(num_destinations):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(amount[i, j] for i in range(num_terminals)) >= demands[j], f"Demand_Constraint_Destination_{j}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Prepare the output
distribution = [{"from": i, "to": j, "amount": amount[i, j].varValue} for i in range(num_terminals) for j in range(num_destinations)]
total_cost = pulp.value(problem.objective)

#### Print results
output = {
    "distribution": distribution,
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This script models and solves the transportation problem using linear programming. It defines decision variables for the quantities of soybeans shipped on each route, sets up the cost minimization objective, enforces supply constraints at terminals, and demand constraints at destinations.
