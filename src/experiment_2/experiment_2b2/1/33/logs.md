<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- The knapsack problem has a significant place in the study of integer programming models with binary variables. 
- In the knapsack problem, one needs to pack a set of items in a container.
- Each item \var{k} has value \var{value_{k}} and size \var{size_{k}}.
- And the container has maximum capacity \var{C}. 
- If the total size of the items exceeds the capacity, we can't pack them all. 
- In that case, the problem is to choose a subset of the items of maximum total value that will fit in the container. 

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"C": C,
	"value": [value_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
	"size": [size_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Maximize the total value of the packed items

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{isincluded} represents whether each item is included in the container

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"isincluded": [isincluded_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}
</DESCRIPTION>

```python
import pulp

#### Load the data
data = {'C': 10, 'value': [10, 20], 'size': [8, 6]}

#### Create the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Knapsack Problem", pulp.LpMaximize)

#### Number of items
K = len(data["value"])

#### Decision variables
is_included = [pulp.LpVariable(f"is_included_{k}", cat='Binary') for k in range(K)]

#### Objective function
problem += pulp.lpSum(data["value"][k] * is_included[k] for k in range(K)), "Total Value"

#### Constraint: total size cannot exceed capacity
problem += pulp.lpSum(data["size"][k] * is_included[k] for k in range(K)) <= data["C"], "Capacity"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Prepare the output
output = {
    "isincluded": [int(is_included[k].varValue) for k in range(K)]
}

#### Print output
print(output)

#### Print objective value
print(f'(Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
