PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

## START MESSAGE 1 
### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve the problem of determining the optimal path through the grid with minimal travel time using linear programming in Python with the PuLP library, we can set up the problem as follows:

######### Steps to Solve:

1. **Define the Decision Variables:**
   - For each intersection, define two binary variables indicating whether the delivery person moves north or west.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - Minimize the total time taken, which is the sum of the products of walking time and the decision variables for each possible move (north or west).

3. **Constraints:**
   - Ensure that the delivery person starts at the starting point and ends at the destination.
   - For each intersection, ensure the flow conservation such that the number of paths entering and leaving each node is balanced except at the start and end nodes.

Here's how you can implement it in Python using PuLP:

```python
import pulp

#### Load the data
data = {'west_time': [[3.5, 4.5], [4, 4], [5, 4]], 'north_time': [[10, 10, 9], [9, 9, 12]]}

west_time = data['west_time']
north_time = data['north_time']

N = len(north_time) + 1
W = len(west_time[0]) + 1

#### Create the LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("DeliveryPathOptimization", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables: x_nw (move west), y_nw (move north)
x_vars = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("x", ((n, w) for n in range(1, N+1) for w in range(1, W)), cat='Binary')
y_vars = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("y", ((n, w) for n in range(1, N+1) for w in range(1, W+1)), cat='Binary')

#### Objective function
problem += (
    pulp.lpSum(west_time[n-1][w-1] * x_vars[(n, w)] for n in range(1, N+1) for w in range(1, W)) +
    pulp.lpSum(north_time[n-1][w-1] * y_vars[(n, w)] for n in range(1, N) for w in range(1, W+1))
)

#### Constraints
#### Start at (1, 1)
problem += x_vars[(1, 1)] + y_vars[(1, 1)] == 1

#### End at (N, W)
problem += x_vars[(N, W-1)] + y_vars[(N-1, W)] == 1

#### Flow conservation
for n in range(1, N+1):
    for w in range(1, W+1):
        if n == 1 and w == 1:
            continue
        if n == N and w == W:
            continue

        inflow = (x_vars[(n, w-1)] if w > 1 else 0) + (y_vars[(n-1, w)] if n > 1 else 0)
        outflow = (x_vars[(n, w)] if w < W else 0) + (y_vars[(n, w)] if n < N else 0)
        
        problem += inflow == outflow

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract the solution
paths = []
for n in range(1, N+1):
    for w in range(1, W):
        if pulp.value(x_vars[(n, w)]) == 1:
            paths.append((n, w))
for n in range(1, N):
    for w in range(1, W+1):
        if pulp.value(y_vars[(n, w)]) == 1:
            paths.append((n, w))

total_time = pulp.value(problem.objective)

#### Output the result
output = {
    "paths": paths,
    "total_time": total_time
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

######### Explanation:

- **Decision Variables `x_vars` and `y_vars`:** Represent moving west and north respectively.
- **Objective:** Minimize total time by summing over all possible moves multiplied by their respective times.
- **Constraints:**
  - Starting and ending constraints ensure the path begins and ends at specified locations.
  - Flow conservation ensures the balance of paths at each intersection, allowing only valid movements along the grid.

This code will provide the optimal paths and total time taken to deliver the package.
