<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A division of an auto parts manufacturer produces \var{P} different parts using \var{M} different machines.
- Batch of 100 part \var{p} requires \var{time_{m,p}} hours on machine \var{m}.
- The division incurs a charge of \var{cost_{m}} per hour for using machine \var{m}.
- Machine \var{m} has an availability of up to \var{available_{m}} hours per month.
- The division sells part \var{p} in batches of 100 at price of \var{price_{p}} per batch.
- The division must produce at least \var{min_batches_{p}} batches of part \var{p} each month to fulfill a contract.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "time_required": [[time_{m,p} for p in 1, ..., P] for m in 1, ..., M],
    "machine_costs": [cost_{m} for m in 1, ..., M],
    "availability": [available_{m} for m in 1, ..., M],
    "prices": [price_{p} for p in 1, ..., P],
    "min_batches": [min_batches_{p} for p in 1, ..., P]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many batches of each part should the manufacturer produce each month to maximize profit?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the number of batches of each part produced \var{batches_{p}}.
- \var{total_profit} represents the total profit obtained for the month.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "batches": [batches_{p} for p in 1, ..., P],
    "total_profit": total_profit
}

```python
import pulp

#### Problem data from the JSON format
data = {'time_required': [[2, 1, 3, 2], [4, 2, 1, 2], [6, 2, 1, 2]], 
        'machine_costs': [160, 10, 15], 
        'availability': [200, 300, 500], 
        'prices': [570, 250, 585, 430], 
        'min_batches': [10, 10, 10, 10]}

#### Extracting data
time_required = data["time_required"]
machine_costs = data["machine_costs"]
availability = data["availability"]
prices = data["prices"]
min_batches = data["min_batches"]

#### Number of parts and machines
P = len(prices)
M = len(machine_costs)

#### Define the LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Maximize_Profit", pulp.LpMaximize)

#### Decision variables: batches of each part to be produced
batches = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("batches", range(P), lowBound=0, cat='Integer')

#### Objective function: Maximize profit, profit = revenue - costs
revenue = pulp.lpSum([prices[p] * batches[p] for p in range(P)])
cost = pulp.lpSum([machine_costs[m] * pulp.lpSum([time_required[m][p] * batches[p] for p in range(P)]) for m in range(M)])
problem += revenue - cost

#### Add constraints for machine availability
for m in range(M):
    problem += pulp.lpSum([time_required[m][p] * batches[p] for p in range(P)]) <= availability[m]

#### Add constraints for minimum batches of each part
for p in range(P):
    problem += batches[p] >= min_batches[p]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Output results
batches_produced = [pulp.value(batches[p]) for p in range(P)]
total_profit = pulp.value(problem.objective)

#### Print output in the required format
output = {
    "batches": batches_produced,
    "total_profit": total_profit
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
