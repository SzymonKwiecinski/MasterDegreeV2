Background: You are a expert at Operations Research and Linear Programming and Python. Based on description you solve given problem using Pulp python library. Python code place between ```python and ```. You receive the data in json format between: <DATA></DATA>. Do not change data format! Do not use `while` loop in python code! Do not include 'pip install' in script. Assume every python package is installed Print at the end the objective between <OBJ></OBJ> `print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')`

<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- A company produces and sells \var{P} different products. 
- The demand for each product is unlimited, but the company is constrained by cash availability and machine capacity.
- Each unit of the \var{i}-th product requires \var{hour_i} machine hours.
- There are \var{availableHours} machine hours available in the current production period.
- The production costs are \var{cost_i} per unit of the \var{i}-th product.
- The selling prices of the \var{i}-th product is \var{price_i} per unit.
- The available cash is \var{cash}.
- Furthermore, \var{investRate_i} of the sales revenues from the \var{i}-th product will be made available to finance operations during the current period.
- \var{investPercentage_i} is a number between 0 and 1
- The company could increase its available machine hours by \var{upgradeHours}, after spending \var{upgradeCost} for certain repairs. 
- The net income from each product is the revenue we get from selling it minus the production cost and the investment cost.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "cash": cash,
    "hour": [hour_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "cost": [cost_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "price": [price_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "investPercentage": [investPercentage_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "upgradeHours": upgradeHours,   
    "upgradeCost": upgradeCost,
    "availableHours": availableHours,
}

OBJECTIVE: We are aiming at maximizing total net income subject to the cash availability and machine capacity limitations

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{net_income} shows the net income of the company
- \var{production_i} shows the production quantity of the \var{i}-th product
- \var{upgrade} is a boolean variable that shows whether the company should upgrade its machine capacity or not

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "net_income": net_income,
    "production": [production_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "upgrade": true/false,
}

#### Problem data from JSON format
data = {
    'P': 2,
    'Cash': 3000,
    'Hour': [2, 6],
    'Cost': [3, 2],
    'Price': [6, 5],
    'InvestPercentage': [0.4, 0.3],
    'UpgradeHours': 2000,
    'UpgradeCost': 400,
    'AvailableHours': 2000
}

#### Initialize LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Maximize_Net_Income", pulp.LpMaximize)

#### Variables
production = [pulp.LpVariable(f'production_{i}', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous') for i in range(data['P'])]
upgrade = pulp.LpVariable('upgrade', cat='Binary')

#### Objective Function
net_income = pulp.lpSum([(data['Price'][i] - data['Cost'][i] - data['InvestPercentage'][i] * data['Price'][i]) * production[i] for i in range(data['P'])])
problem += net_income

#### Constraints
#### Cash constraint
problem += (pulp.lpSum([data['Cost'][i] * production[i] for i in range(data['P'])]) + upgrade * data['UpgradeCost'] <= data['Cash'])

#### Machine hours constraint
problem += (pulp.lpSum([data['Hour'][i] * production[i] for i in range(data['P'])]) <= data['AvailableHours'] + upgrade * data['UpgradeHours'])

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Results
net_income_result = pulp.value(net_income)
production_result = [pulp.value(production[i]) for i in range(data['P'])]
upgrade_result = bool(pulp.value(upgrade))

#### Output in the specified format
output = {
    "net_income": net_income_result,
    "production": production_result,
    "upgrade": upgrade_result,
}

print(output)
