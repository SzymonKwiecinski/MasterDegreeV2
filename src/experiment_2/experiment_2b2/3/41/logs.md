<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem using the PuLP library, we will formulate it as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. The goal is to minimize the number of floppy disks used to store all the files, given the constraint that the total size of files on any disk doesn't exceed its capacity.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
import pulp

#### Data from the JSON input
data = {'capacity': 3, 'size': [1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}

#### Capacity of each floppy disk
capacity = data['capacity']

#### Sizes of files
sizes = data['size']

#### Number of files
num_files = len(sizes)

#### Create a problem variable to minimize the number of disks used
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Disks", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### We will use a maximum of `num_files` disks because each file could theoretically be on a separate disk
max_disks = num_files

#### Binary variable array indicating if a disk is used
disk_used = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("DiskUsed", range(max_disks), cat='Binary')

#### Binary variable matrix indicating if a file is stored on a specific disk
file_on_disk = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("FileOnDisk", (range(num_files), range(max_disks)), cat='Binary')

#### Objective function: Minimize the number of disks used
problem += pulp.lpSum(disk_used[d] for d in range(max_disks))

#### Constraints
#### A file must be on exactly one disk
for f in range(num_files):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(file_on_disk[f][d] for d in range(max_disks)) == 1

#### The total size of files on any disk must not exceed the disk's capacity
for d in range(max_disks):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(file_on_disk[f][d] * sizes[f] for f in range(num_files)) <= capacity * disk_used[d]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract the results
n_disks = sum(disk_used[d].value() for d in range(max_disks))
whichdisk = [next(d for d in range(max_disks) if file_on_disk[f][d].value() == 1) for f in range(num_files)]

#### Output the results in the specified format
output = {
    "n_disks": int(n_disks),
    "whichdisk": whichdisk
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This code sets up the optimization problem, defines the constraints, and solves for the minimal number of disks required to store the files. It outputs the number of disks used and the assignment of each file to a disk.
