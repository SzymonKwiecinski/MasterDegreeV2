PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- A company must deliver \var{deliver_i} units of its product at the end of the \var{i}_th month.
- Material produced during a month can be delivered either at the end of the same month or can be stored as inventory and delivered at the end of a subsequent month.
- There is a storage cost of \var{storage_cost} dollars per month for each unit of product held in inventory. 
- The year begins with zero inventory. 
- If the company produces \var{x_i} units in month \var{i} and \var{x_{i+1}} units in month \var{i}+1, it incurs a cost of \var{switch_cost} |\var{x_{i+1}} - \var{x_i}|  dollars, reflecting the cost of switching to a new production level. 
- Assume that inventory left at the end of the year has no value and does not incur any storage cost.
- The company wants to minimize the total cost of the production and inventory schedule over the next \var{T} months.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "deliver": [deliver_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "storage_cost": storage_cost,
    "switch_cost": switch_cost,
}

OBJECTIVE: Minimize the total cost of the production and inventory schedule over the whole period.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{x_i} is the number of units produced in month \var{i}.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "cost": cost,
}

## START MESSAGE 4 
### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
The error is caused by trying to use the `abs()` function on a PuLP `LpAffineExpression` object. We need to handle the absolute difference by introducing auxiliary variables. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import pulp

#### Data
data = {
    'T': 12, 
    'Deliver': [100, 120, 110, 130, 150, 100, 90, 110, 95, 125, 130, 100], 
    'StorageCost': 5, 
    'SwitchCost': 10
}

#### Variables
T = data['T']
deliver = data['Deliver']
storage_cost = data['StorageCost']
switch_cost = data['SwitchCost']

#### Create a LP Minimization problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Production_and_Inventory_Problem", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Create variables
x = [pulp.LpVariable(f'x_{i}', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous') for i in range(T)]
inventory = [pulp.LpVariable(f'inv_{i}', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous') for i in range(T)]
switch = [pulp.LpVariable(f'switch_{i}', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous') for i in range(T-1)]

#### Objective function
problem += (pulp.lpSum(storage_cost * inventory[i] for i in range(T))
            + pulp.lpSum(switch_cost * switch[i] for i in range(T-1)), "Total Cost")

#### Constraints
#### Initial inventory is zero
problem += inventory[0] == (x[0] - deliver[0])

for i in range(1, T):
    #### Inventory balance constraints
    problem += inventory[i] == (inventory[i-1] + x[i] - deliver[i])

for i in range(T-1):
    #### Switch constraints to handle absolute value
    problem += switch[i] >= x[i+1] - x[i]
    problem += switch[i] >= x[i] - x[i+1]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Results
results = {
    "x": [pulp.value(x[i]) for i in range(T)],
    "cost": pulp.value(problem.objective)
}

print(f'Production Plan: {results}')
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```
