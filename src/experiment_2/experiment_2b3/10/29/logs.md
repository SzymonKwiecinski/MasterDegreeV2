<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A quantity y is known to depend on another quantity x. A set of corresponding values has been collected for x and y and is presented.
- The \var{k}-th y value takes \var{y_{k}} and the \var{k}-th x value takes \var{x_{k}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "y": [y_{k} for k = 1,...,K],
    "x": [x_{k} for k = 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Fit the ‘best’ straight line y = bx + a where the objective is to minimize the maximum deviation of all the observed values of y from the value predicted by the linear relationship.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{intercept} represents the intercept of the fitted line
- \var{slope} represents the slope of the fitted line

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this Linear Programming problem using the PuLP library in Python, we need to determine the linear relationship between the variables \(x\) and \(y\) that minimizes the maximum deviation of the observed \(y\) values from the predicted values on the line \(y = bx + a\). 

Here's the full Python code that implements the solution:

```python
import pulp

#### Data from JSON
data = {'NumObs': 19, 'Y': [1.0, 0.9, 0.7, 1.5, 2.0, 2.4, 3.2, 2.0, 2.7, 3.5, 1.0, 4.0, 3.6, 2.7, 5.7, 4.6, 6.0, 6.8, 7.3], 'X': [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 1.9, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.6, 7.0, 7.6, 8.5, 9.0, 10.0]}

#### Extract data
Y = data['Y']
X = data['X']
NumObs = data['NumObs']

#### Define the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Maximum_Deviation", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Define decision variables
a = pulp.LpVariable('a', lowBound=None, upBound=None, cat='Continuous')  #### Intercept
b = pulp.LpVariable('b', lowBound=None, upBound=None, cat='Continuous')  #### Slope
z = pulp.LpVariable('z', lowBound=0, upBound=None, cat='Continuous')     #### Maximum deviation

#### Objective: Minimize the maximum deviation (z)
problem += z, "Objective is to minimize the maximum deviation"

#### Add constraints to ensure absolute deviations are captured
for i in range(NumObs):
    yi = Y[i]
    xi = X[i]
    problem += yi - (b * xi + a) <= z, f"Deviation_positive_{i}"
    problem += (b * xi + a) - yi <= z, f"Deviation_negative_{i}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract results
intercept = pulp.value(a)
slope = pulp.value(b)

#### Prepare output
output = {
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

The script captures the essence of fitting a straight line to the data while minimizing the maximum deviation. The deviations are captured by the variable \(z\), which the constraints ensure always holds the maximum absolute deviation between observed and predicted values. After running the script, it will print the intercept and slope of the fitted line, as well as the minimum maximum deviation.
