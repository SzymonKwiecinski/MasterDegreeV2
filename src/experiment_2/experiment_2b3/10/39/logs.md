<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- To operate a cafeteria, the manager must ensure on-call duty based on the statistics on the required staff. 
- In the future days, the number of desired employees on day \var{n} is denoted with \var{num_{n}}.
- Each employee works \var{n_working_days} days in a row and then has \var{n_resting_days} days off.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"num": [num_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"n_working_days": n_working_days,
	"n_resting_days": n_resting_days
}


OBJECTIVE: Calculate the minimum number of employees to hire

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_number} represents the total number of employees to employ
- \var{is_work} represents whether employee is working a rest on each day. Its length is determined by \var{total_number}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"total_number": total_number,
	"is_work": [[is_work_{n, i} for n in 1,...,N] for i in 1,...,total_number]
}

## START MESSAGE 1 
### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we need to structure it as a linear programming problem. The goal is to minimize the number of employees needed to satisfy the required number of staff each day, given that each employee works a fixed number of consecutive days and then rests for a fixed number of days.

```python
import pulp

#### Input data
data = {'num': [5, 10, 2, 3, 2, 10], 'n_working_days': 5, 'n_resting_days': 2}
num = data['num']
N = len(num)
n_working_days = data['n_working_days']
n_resting_days = data['n_resting_days']

#### Create the LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Employees", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
#### x[i] is 1 if we hire the ith employee, 0 otherwise, up to some reasonable maximum number of employees
max_employees = sum(num)  #### Upper bound on the number of employees needed
x = [pulp.LpVariable(f'x_{i}', cat='Binary') for i in range(max_employees)]

#### y[n][i] is 1 if the ith employee works on the nth day, 0 otherwise
#### This is a binary matrix of size (max_employees x N)
y = [[pulp.LpVariable(f'y_{i}_{n}', cat='Binary') for n in range(N)] for i in range(max_employees)]

#### Objective: Minimize the number of employees
problem += pulp.lpSum(x)

#### Constraints
#### Each day `n`, the number of working employees must be at least `num[n]`
for n in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(y[i][n] for i in range(max_employees)) >= num[n]

#### Working pattern constraints: If employee `i` is hired, they work `n_working_days` days in a row and then `n_resting_days` rest
for i in range(max_employees):
    for start in range(N):
        #### Calculate which days the employee works if they start on a given day
        for j in range(n_working_days):
            if start + j < N:
                problem += y[i][start + j] <= x[i]
        #### Calculate which days the employee rests after working
        for j in range(n_resting_days):
            if start + n_working_days + j < N:
                problem += y[i][start + n_working_days + j] == 0

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract results
total_number = int(pulp.value(problem.objective))
is_work = [[int(pulp.value(y[i][n])) for n in range(N)] for i in range(total_number) if pulp.value(x[i]) == 1]

#### Output
output = {
    "total_number": total_number,
    "is_work": is_work
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This script sets up an integer linear programming problem to minimize the number of employees needed while adhering to the constraints of working and resting days. It solves the problem using PuLP and outputs the total number of employees and their working schedule.
