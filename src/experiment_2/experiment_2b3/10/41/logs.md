<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

<DATA>
{'capacity': 3, 'size': [1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}</DATA>


## START MESSAGE 1 
### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem using PuLP, we will set up a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. We'll create variables to indicate which disk each file is assigned to, and minimize the number of disks used.

```python
import pulp

#### Input Data
data = {'capacity': 3, 'size': [1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}
capacity = data['capacity']
sizes = data['size']
N = len(sizes)

#### MILP Model
problem = pulp.LpProblem("FloppyDiskBackup", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Variables: x[i][j] is 1 if file i is stored on disk j, otherwise 0
x = [[pulp.LpVariable(f"x_{i}_{j}", cat='Binary') for j in range(N)] for i in range(N)]

#### Variable: y[j] is 1 if disk j is used, otherwise 0
y = [pulp.LpVariable(f"y_{j}", cat='Binary') for j in range(N)]

#### Objective: Minimize the number of disks used
problem += pulp.lpSum(y)

#### Constraints: Each file must be on exactly one disk
for i in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[i][j] for j in range(N)) == 1

#### Constraints: Disk capacity
for j in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(sizes[i] * x[i][j] for i in range(N)) <= capacity * y[j]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract the results
n_disks = int(sum(y[j].varValue for j in range(N)))
whichdisk = [j for i in range(N) for j in range(N) if x[i][j].varValue == 1]

#### Output
result = {
    "n_disks": n_disks,
    "whichdisk": whichdisk
}

print(result)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This code will set up the MILP problem, solve it, and print the number of disks used and the assignment of files to each disk.
