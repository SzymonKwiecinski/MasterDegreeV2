PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- An Italian transport company must send empty containers from its depots to ports. 
- The number of containers available in the depot \var{i} is denoted with \var{numdepot_i}. 
- Container requirement in port \var{j} is \var{numport_{j}}. 
- Transport of containers is by barges. 
- Each barge can only contain two containers and the cost of transport (per barge) is proportional to the distance traveled (price is \var{price} Euros/km).
- The distances between depot \var{i} and port \var{j} is \var{distance_{i, j}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"numdepot": [numdepot_{i} for i in 1,...,I],
	"numport": [numport_{j} for j in 1,...,J],
	"price": price,
	"distance": [[distance_{i, j} for i in 1,...I] for j in 1,...,J]
}


OBJECTIVE: Minimize the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT INFO:

\var{number} represents the number of containers sent from each depot to port

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"number": [[number_{i, j} for i in 1,...,I] for j in 1,...,J]
}
