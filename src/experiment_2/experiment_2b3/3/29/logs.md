<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A quantity y is known to depend on another quantity x. A set of corresponding values has been collected for x and y and is presented.
- The \var{k}-th y value takes \var{y_{k}} and the \var{k}-th x value takes \var{x_{k}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "y": [y_{k} for k = 1,...,K],
    "x": [x_{k} for k = 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Fit the ‘best’ straight line y = bx + a where the objective is to minimize the maximum deviation of all the observed values of y from the value predicted by the linear relationship.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{intercept} represents the intercept of the fitted line
- \var{slope} represents the slope of the fitted line

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we will use the Pulp library to formulate and solve a linear programming problem. Our objective is to fit a straight line \( y = bx + a \) such that the maximum deviation from the observed values is minimized. Let's proceed with the code.

```python
import pulp

#### Data extracted from the given JSON format
data = {
    'NumObs': 19,
    'Y': [1.0, 0.9, 0.7, 1.5, 2.0, 2.4, 3.2, 2.0, 2.7, 3.5, 1.0, 4.0, 3.6, 2.7, 5.7, 4.6, 6.0, 6.8, 7.3],
    'X': [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 1.9, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.6, 7.0, 7.6, 8.5, 9.0, 10.0]
}

#### Number of observations
K = data['NumObs']
Y = data['Y']
X = data['X']

#### Define the linear programming problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Maximum_Deviation", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision Variables
a = pulp.LpVariable('Intercept', lowBound=None, upBound=None)
b = pulp.LpVariable('Slope', lowBound=None, upBound=None)
d = pulp.LpVariable('Maximum_Deviation', lowBound=0)

#### Objective Function: Minimize Maximum Deviation
problem += d, "Objective: Minimize Maximum Deviation"

#### Constraints to ensure deviation is calculated correctly
for k in range(K):
    problem += Y[k] - (a + b * X[k]) <= d, f"DeviationUpperBound_{k}"
    problem += (a + b * X[k]) - Y[k] <= d, f"DeviationLowerBound_{k}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Output the results
intercept = pulp.value(a)
slope = pulp.value(b)

output = {
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This script defines a linear programming problem using the Pulp library to minimize the maximum deviation between a set of observed data points and the values predicted by a line defined by the slope `b` and intercept `a`. Every observed pair \( (x_k, y_k) \) is constrained to ensure that the deviation does not exceed the variable `d`, which is minimized. The solution provides the best-fit line parameters `intercept` and `slope`, and the minimized maximum deviation value for further analysis.
