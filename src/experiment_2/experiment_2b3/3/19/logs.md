<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A food is manufactured by refining raw oils and blending them together. 
- The raw oils are either vegetable oils or non-vegetable oils. 
- Each oil \var{i} may be purchased in month \var{m} for price \var{price_{i,m}}.
- The final product sells at \var{sell_price} per ton.
- Vegetable oils and non-vegetable oils require different production lines for refining. 
- In any month, it is not possible to refine more than \var{max_vegetable_refining_per_month} tons of vegetable oils and more than \var{max_non_vegetable_refining_per_month} tons of non-vegetable oils. 
- There is no loss of weight in the refining process, and the cost of refining may be ignored.
- It is possible to store up to \var{storage_size} tons of each raw oil for use later. 
- The cost of storage for both vegetable and non-vegetable oil is \var{storage_cost} per ton per month.
- The final product cannot be stored, nor can refined oils be stored.
- There is a technological restriction of hardness on the final product. 
- In the units in which hardness is measured, this must lie between \var{max_hardness} and \var{min_hardness}.
- The hardness product is computed by the weighted average of hardness of each oil.
- The hardness of oil \var{i} is \var{hardness_{i}}.
- At present, there are \var{init_amount} tons of each type of raw oil in storage. 
- We can assume that there is a month "0" to model the inital amount.
- It is required that at the end of the last month, we still have the same amout of storage as \var{init_amount}.
- This means directly adding the constraint that the storage in the last month must be equal to \var{init_amount}.
- The food may never be made up of more than three oils in any month.
- If an oil is used in a month, at least \var{min_usage} tons must be used.
- There are dependencies in the oil usage and \var{dependency_{i, j}} shows this relation
- If \var{dependency_{i, j}} is 1, then when oil \var{i} is used, oil \var{j} must also be used

The error you encountered is due to trying to directly compare a PuLP `LpAffineExpression` object to an integer.

#### Objective

######### Changes Made:
1. **Hardness Calculation**: The calculation for `weighted_hardness` now includes a small value (`1e-5`) added to the denominator to avoid division by zero when `total_refine` is zero.
2. Ensured that all constraints and variables are correctly defined, maintaining the logic provided in the initial description.

This updated code should work without producing the previous error and fulfill the requirements of the problem statement.
