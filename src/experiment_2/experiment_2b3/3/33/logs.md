<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- The knapsack problem has a significant place in the study of integer programming models with binary variables. 
- In the knapsack problem, one needs to pack a set of items in a container.
- Each item \var{k} has value \var{value_{k}} and size \var{size_{k}}.
- And the container has maximum capacity \var{C}. 
- If the total size of the items exceeds the capacity, we can't pack them all. 
- In that case, the problem is to choose a subset of the items of maximum total value that will fit in the container. 

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"C": C,
	"value": [value_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
	"size": [size_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Maximize the total value of the packed items

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{isincluded} represents whether each item is included in the container

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"isincluded": [isincluded_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}
</DESCRIPTION>
