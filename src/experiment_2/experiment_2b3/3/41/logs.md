Background: You are a expert at Operations Research and Linear Programming and Python. Based on description you solve given problem using Pulp python library. Python code place between ```python and ```. You receive the data in json format between: <DATA></DATA>. Do not change data format! Do not use `while` loop in python code! Do not include 'pip install' in script. Assume every python package is installed Print at the end the objective between <OBJ></OBJ> `print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')`

<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
```python
import pulp

#### Data extracted from the JSON format
data = {'capacity': 3, 'size': [1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}

#### Problem setup
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Disk_Minimization", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Constants
capacity = data['capacity']
sizes = data['size']
N = len(sizes)  #### Number of files

#### Variables
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("x", ((i, j) for i in range(N) for j in range(N)), cat='Binary')
y = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("y", (i for i in range(N)), cat='Binary')

#### Objective: Minimize number of disks used
problem += pulp.lpSum(y[i] for i in range(N))

#### Constraints
#### 1. Each file must be stored in exactly one disk
for j in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[(i, j)] for i in range(N)) == 1

#### 2. The total size of files on each disk i should not exceed the disk capacity
for i in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[(i, j)] * sizes[j] for j in range(N)) <= capacity * y[i]

#### Solving the problem
problem.solve()

#### Results
n_disks = sum(y[i].varValue for i in range(N))
whichdisk = [next(i for i in range(N) if pulp.value(x[(i, j)]) == 1) for j in range(N)]

output = {
    "n_disks": int(n_disks),
    "whichdisk": whichdisk
}

print(output)
