PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- Consider a set \var{P} described by linear inequality constraints, that is:
 \var{P} = {\var{x} \in R^\var{N} | \var{a_i}^T x <= \var{b_i} , i = 1, ..., m}.

where \var{a_i} \in R^\var{N} and \var{b_i} \in R

- A ball with center \var{y} in R^\var{N} and radius \var{r} is defined as the set of all points within (Euclidean) distance \var{r} from \var{y}.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "A": [[a_i_j for j in 1, ..., n] for i in 1, ..., m],
    "b": [b_i for i in 1, ..., m]
}

OBJECTIVE: We are interested in finding a ball with the largest possible radius, which is entirely contained within the set \var{P} (The center of such a ball is called the Chebychev center of \var{P}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- center (list): The center of the ball as a list of floats of length \var{N}
- radius (float): The radius of the ball as a float

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "center": [y_j for j in 1, ..., n],
    "radius": r
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve the given problem using the Pulp library, we will maximize the radius \( r \) of a ball centered at \( y \) such that the ball is entirely contained within the polyhedron defined by the linear inequalities \( a_i^T x \leq b_i \).

Here's how we can implement this in Python using Pulp:

```python
import pulp
import math

#### Parse the input data
data = {'M': 4, 'N': 2, 'A': [[1.0, 0.0], [-1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, -1.0]], 'B': [2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0]}
A = data['A']
B = data['B']
M = data['M']
N = data['N']

#### Create a Linear Programming problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("ChebychevCenter", pulp.LpMaximize)

#### Define the variables y (center of the ball) and r (radius of the ball)
y = [pulp.LpVariable(f'y_{j}', cat='Continuous') for j in range(N)]
r = pulp.LpVariable('r', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')  #### Radius cannot be negative

#### Objective function: Maximize the radius r
problem += r

#### Constraints: Each constraint should maintain the ball within the polyhedron
for i in range(M):
    #### Constraint: a_i^T * y + r * ||a_i|| <= b_i
    norm_a_i = math.sqrt(sum(aij * aij for aij in A[i]))  #### Euclidean norm of a_i
    problem += (pulp.lpSum(A[i][j] * y[j] for j in range(N)) + r * norm_a_i <= B[i])

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract the results
center = [pulp.value(var) for var in y]
radius = pulp.value(r)

#### Print the result in the specified format
output = {"center": center, "radius": radius}
print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This code sets up the LP problem with the defined constraints and maximizes the radius of the largest possible ball that can fit entirely within the specified set of inequalities. The center of this ball, along with the radius, is computed and printed in the specified output format.
