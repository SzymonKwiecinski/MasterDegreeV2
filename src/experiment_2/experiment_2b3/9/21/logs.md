PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- An engineering factory makes several products on the machines, and the number of machine \var{m} the factory has is \var{num_{m}}.
- Each product \var{k} yields \var{profit_{k}} to profit (defined as £/unit selling price minus cost of raw materials).
- The unit production times (hours) product \var{k} requires on machine \var{m} is \var{time_{k, m}}
- In the present month (January) and several subsequent months, certain machines will be down for maintenance.
- Each machine \var{m} has to be down for \var{down_{m}} months for maintenance.
- There are marketing limitations on each product in each month. 
- The limitation of product \var{k} in month \var{i} is \var{limit_{k, i}}.
- It is possible to store up to 100 of each product at a time at a cost of \var{store_price} per unit per month. 
- There are no stocks at present, but it is desired to have a stock of \var{keep_quantity} of each type of product at the end of subsequent months.
- The factory works a six days a week with two shifts of \var{n_workhours} hours each day. 
- No sequencing problems need to be considered.
- We can assume that a month has 24 days for convenience.

The error you're encountering is likely due to the way the input data is structured. Specifically, the `time` list should have dimensions corresponding to \( K \times M \), where \( K \) is the number of products and \( M \) is the number of machines.

######### Changes Made:
1. **Maintenance Variable Bounds**: The `maintain` variable was set to be binary since a machine can either be under maintenance (1) or not (0).
2. **Production Time Constraint**: The hours calculation for each machine has been corrected to consider the downtime of the machine.
3. **Fixed Indexing**: Ensured consistent indexing and dimension checks across all constraints.

This should resolve the `IndexError` you encountered. Please make sure your input data structure aligns with the expected dimensions of the variables.
