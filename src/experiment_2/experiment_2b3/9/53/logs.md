PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
        for id in 1, ..., m
    ],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this transportation problem using linear programming, we will utilize the PuLP library in Python. Here's the process we'll follow:

1. Define the decision variables for the amount of soybeans shipped between each terminal and destination.
2. Set up the objective function to minimize the total transportation cost.
3. Add constraints for supply at each terminal and demand at each destination.
4. Solve the LP problem to find the optimal transportation plan.

Below is the Python code implementation:

```python
import pulp

#### Read the input data
data = {
    'NumTerminals': 3,
    'NumDestinations': 4,
    'Cost': [[34, 49, 17, 26], [52, 64, 23, 14], [20, 28, 12, 17]],
    'Demand': [65, 70, 50, 45],
    'Supply': [150, 100, 100]
}

#### Extract the data
num_terminals = data['NumTerminals']
num_destinations = data['NumDestinations']
cost = data['Cost']
demand = data['Demand']
supply = data['Supply']

#### Create the LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Soybean_Transportation", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Create decision variables
amount = pulp.LpVariable.dicts(
    "amount",
    ((i, j) for i in range(num_terminals) for j in range(num_destinations)),
    lowBound=0,
    cat='Continuous'
)

#### Objective function
problem += pulp.lpSum(cost[i][j] * amount[i, j] for i in range(num_terminals) for j in range(num_destinations))

#### Constraints for supply
for i in range(num_terminals):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(amount[i, j] for j in range(num_destinations)) <= supply[i]

#### Constraints for demand
for j in range(num_destinations):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(amount[i, j] for i in range(num_terminals)) >= demand[j]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Output the results
distribution = [{"from": i, "to": j, "amount": amount[i, j].varValue}
                for i in range(num_terminals) 
                for j in range(num_destinations)]

total_cost = pulp.value(problem.objective)

result = {
    "distribution": distribution,
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

print(result)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

Run this code to solve the problem and print the optimal transportation plan along with the minimized total transportation cost. The `result` dictionary will contain the distribution details of soybeans from each terminal to each destination and the total transportation cost.
