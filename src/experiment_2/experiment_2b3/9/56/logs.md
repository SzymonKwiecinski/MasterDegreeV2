PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem using the PuLP library in Python, we need to model it as a linear programming problem. We will define binary decision variables indicating whether a path is taken or not, and minimize the total travel time.

Here's how the problem is solved:

```python
import pulp

#### The given data
data = {
    'west_time': [[3.5, 4.5], [4, 4], [5, 4]], 
    'north_time': [[10, 10, 9], [9, 9, 12]]
}

#### Unpack data
west_time = data['west_time']
north_time = data['north_time']

#### Dimensions
N = len(north_time) + 1
W = len(west_time[0]) + 1

#### Initialize the LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Travel_Time", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
x_north = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("north", [(n, w) for n in range(N-1) for w in range(W)], cat='Binary')
x_west = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("west", [(n, w) for n in range(N) for w in range(W-1)], cat='Binary')

#### Objective function: Minimize total travel time
total_time = (
    pulp.lpSum(north_time[n][w] * x_north[n, w] for n in range(N-1) for w in range(W)) +
    pulp.lpSum(west_time[n][w] * x_west[n, w] for n in range(N) for w in range(W-1))
)
problem += total_time

#### Constraints

#### Flow entering starting point (1,1)
problem += x_north[0, 0] + x_west[0, 0] == 1

#### Flow conservation for each intersection (n, w)
for n in range(N):
    for w in range(W):
        if n == 0 and w == 0:
            continue  #### Start point constraints already added
        inflow = 0
        outflow = 0
        
        if n > 0:
            inflow += x_north[n-1, w]
        if w > 0:
            inflow += x_west[n, w-1]
        
        if n < N-1:
            outflow += x_north[n, w]
        if w < W-1:
            outflow += x_west[n, w]
        
        problem += inflow == outflow

#### Flow leaving destination point (N, W)
problem += x_north[N-2, W-1] + x_west[N-1, W-2] == 1

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract the path
paths = []
for n in range(N-1):
    for w in range(W):
        if pulp.value(x_north[n, w]) == 1:
            paths.append((n+1, w+1))

for n in range(N):
    for w in range(W-1):
        if pulp.value(x_west[n, w]) == 1:
            paths.append((n+1, w+1))

#### Collect results
result = {
    "paths": paths,
    "total_time": pulp.value(problem.objective)
}

print(result)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This will calculate the optimal path to take and the corresponding minimal travel time on the grid provided in the dataset.
