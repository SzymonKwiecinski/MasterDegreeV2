PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- Consider a communication network consisting of \var{n} nodes.
- Nodes are conÂ­nected by communication links.
- A link allowing one-way transmission from node \var{i} to node \var{j} is described by an ordered pair (\var{i},\var{j}). 
- Let \var{A} be the set of all links. 
- We assume that each link (\var{i},\var{j}) \in \var{A} can carry up to \var{U_{i,j}} bits per second. 
- There is a positive cost \var{C_{i,j}} per bit transmitted along that link. 
- Each node \var{k} generates data, at the rate of \var{B_{k,l}} bits per second, that have to be transmitted to node \var{l}, either through a direct link (\var{k}, \var{l}) or by tracing a sequence of links. 
- We allow the data with the same origin and destination to be split and be transmitted along different paths.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "links": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "U": U_{i,j},
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "data": [
        {
            "source": k,
            "destination": l,
            "rate": B_{k,l}
        }
    ]
}


OBJECTIVE: Find paths along which all data reach their intended destinations, while minimizing the total cost. 



OUTPUT INFO:
- \var{total_cost} represents the total cost of all the paths
- \var{path_cost} represents the cost of the corresponding path
- \var{path_flow} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve the given Linear Programming problem using the Pulp library in Python, we need to set up the problem with the provided data and constraints.

```python
import pulp

#### Input data
data = {'NumLinks': 4, 'StartNode': [1, 2, 2, 3], 'EndNode': [2, 3, 4, 4], 'Capacity': [50, 40, 60, 50], 'Cost': [2, 3, 1, 1], 'NumFlowReqs': 2, 'Source': [1, 2], 'Destination': [4, 3], 'DataRate': [40, 30]}

#### Unpacking data
start_nodes = data['StartNode']
end_nodes = data['EndNode']
capacities = data['Capacity']
costs = data['Cost']
sources = data['Source']
destinations = data['Destination']
data_rates = data['DataRate']

#### Create a list of all nodes
nodes = set(start_nodes + end_nodes)

#### Create a list of all edges
edges = [(start_nodes[i], end_nodes[i]) for i in range(len(start_nodes))]

#### Create a dictionary for capacities and costs
U = {(start_nodes[i], end_nodes[i]): capacities[i] for i in range(len(start_nodes))}
C = {(start_nodes[i], end_nodes[i]): costs[i] for i in range(len(start_nodes))}

#### Create the LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem('MinCostFlow', pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Create a dictionary to hold flow variables for each edge and flow requirement
flow = {(i, j, k, l): pulp.LpVariable(f'flow_{i}_{j}_{k}_{l}', 0, U[(i, j)]) 
        for i, j in edges for k, l in zip(sources, destinations)}

#### Objective function: Minimize the total cost of all the paths
problem += pulp.lpSum(flow[i, j, k, l] * C[i, j] for i, j in edges for k, l in zip(sources, destinations))

#### Constraints

#### Capacity constraints: Sum of flow on each edge must not exceed its capacity
for i, j in edges:
    problem += pulp.lpSum(flow[i, j, k, l] for k, l in zip(sources, destinations)) <= U[i, j]

#### Flow conservation constraints for each node and flow requirement
for k, l in zip(sources, destinations):
    for node in nodes:
        if node == k:
            problem += pulp.lpSum(flow[i, j, k, l] for i, j in edges if i == node) - pulp.lpSum(flow[i, j, k, l] for i, j in edges if j == node) == data_rates[sources.index(k)]
        elif node == l:
            problem += pulp.lpSum(flow[i, j, k, l] for i, j in edges if i == node) - pulp.lpSum(flow[i, j, k, l] for i, j in edges if j == node) == -data_rates[sources.index(k)]
        else:
            problem += pulp.lpSum(flow[i, j, k, l] for i, j in edges if i == node) - pulp.lpSum(flow[i, j, k, l] for i, j in edges if j == node) == 0

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extracting the solution
optimized_paths = {'paths': []}

for k, l in zip(sources, destinations):
    path_cost = 0
    path_flow = 0
    route = []
    for i, j in edges:
        if flow[i, j, k, l].varValue > 0:
            path_cost += flow[i, j, k, l].varValue * C[i, j]
            path_flow += flow[i, j, k, l].varValue
            route.extend([i, j])
    route = list(dict.fromkeys(route))  #### Remove duplicates while maintaining order
    optimized_paths['paths'].append({
        'source': k,
        'destination': l,
        'route': route,
        'path_flow': path_flow,
        'path_cost': path_cost
    })

total_cost = pulp.value(problem.objective)
optimized_paths['total_cost'] = total_cost

#### Output the optimized paths
import json
print(json.dumps(optimized_paths, indent=4))
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This code sets up and solves a linear programming problem to find the optimal paths for the given communication network, minimizing the total cost of transmitting data while satisfying the constraints.
