PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A fine foods company produces gift baskets for a season that lasts \var{W} weeks.
- The demand for week \var{w} is \var{demand_{w}} and the demand must be met.
- Regular labor is available for \var{regular_labor_{w}} hours per week and costs $\var{regular_cost}/h.
- Overtime labor is available for \var{overtime_labor_{w}} hours per week and costs $\var{overtime_cost}/h.
- Each basket takes \var{assembly_time} hours of labor to assemble.
- The material cost for each basket is $\var{material_cost} and it sells for $\var{selling_price}.
- Unsold baskets from a week incur a $\var{holding_cost} holding cost. 
- No baskets are available at the start of week 1.
- Unsold baskets at the end of week \var{W} have a salvage value of $var{salvage_value} and do not incur a holding cost.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "regular_cost": regular_cost,
    "overtime_cost": overtime_cost,
    "assembly_time": assembly_time,
    "material_cost": material_cost,

    "regular_labor": [regular_labor_{w} for w in 1, ..., W],
    "overtime_labor": [overtime_labor_{w} for w in 1, ..., W]
}

OBJECTIVE: How much regular and overtime labor should be utilized each week to assemble the baskets to maximize the profit over the season?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the hours of regular labor used each week \var{regular_used_{w}}.
- the hours of overtime labor used each week \var{overtime_used_{w}}.
- the number of baskets assembled with regular labor \var{regular_basket_{w}}.
- the number of baskets assembled with overtime labor \var{overtime_basket_{w}}.
- the number of baskets on hand at the end of week \var{inventory_{w}}.
- \var{total_profit} shows the total profit of the company for the season.
