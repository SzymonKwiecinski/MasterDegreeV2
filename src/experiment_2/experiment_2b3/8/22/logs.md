<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements in future years. 
- Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. 
- In addition to this, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, which will reduce the need for workers in all categories.
- The estimated manpower requirements for manpower \var{k} in year \var{i} is \var{requirement_{k, i}}.
- The current number of manpower \var{k} is \var{strength_{k}}.
- The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to recruitment, retraining, redundancy and short-time working in the next years.
- There is a natural wastage of labour. 
- A fairly large number of workers leave during their first year. After this, the rate of leaving is much smaller. 
- Taking this into account, the wastage rates of manpower \var{k} with less than one year's service is \var{lessonewaste_{k}}.
- The wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with more than one year's service is \var{moreonewaste_{k}}.
- There has been no recent recruitment and all the workers in the current labour force have been employed for more than one year.
- It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. 
- In any one year, the maximum number that can be recruited in manpower \var{k} is \var{recruit_{k}}.
- The redundancy payment to manpower \var{k} is \var{costredundancy_{k}}.
- It is possible to employ up to \var{num_overman} more workers over the whole company than are needed, but the extra costs per employee per year is \var{costoverman_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- Up to \var{num_shortwork} workers in each category of skill can be put on short-time working. 
- The cost of this (per employee per year) is \var{costshort_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of half a full-time employee.

OBJECTIVE: The companyâ€™s declared objective is to minimize redundancy. How should they operate in order to do this?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{recruit} represents the number of each recruit manpower to employ each year
- \var{overmanning} represents the number of each overmanning manpower to employ each year
- \var{short} represents the number of each short-time manpower to employ each year

OUTPUT FORMAT:

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve the given problem using the Pulp Python library, we will set up a linear programming model to minimize redundancy cost while meeting the company's manpower requirements. Below is the solution in Python.

```python
import pulp

#### Data
data = {
    'requirement': [[1000, 1400, 1000], [500, 2000, 1500], [0, 2500, 2000]],
    'strength': [2000, 1500, 1000],
    'lessonewaste': [0.25, 0.2, 0.1],
    'moreonewaste': [0.1, 0.05, 0.05],
    'recruit': [500, 800, 500],
    'costredundancy': [200, 500, 500],
    'num_overman': 150,
    'costoverman': [1500, 2000, 3000],
    'num_shortwork': 50,
    'costshort': [500, 400, 400]
}

#### Indices
K = len(data['requirement'])  #### Number of manpower categories
I = len(data['requirement'][0])  #### Number of years

#### Problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Redundancy", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision Variables
x_recruit = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("Recruit", (range(K), range(I)), lowBound=0, cat='Integer')
x_overman = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("Overmanning", (range(K), range(I)), lowBound=0, cat='Integer')
x_short = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("Short", (range(K), range(I)), lowBound=0, cat='Integer')
x_redundancy = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("Redundancy", (range(K), range(I)), lowBound=0, cat='Integer')

#### Objective Function: Minimize redundancy cost
problem += pulp.lpSum(x_redundancy[k][i] * data['costredundancy'][k] for k in range(K) for i in range(I))

#### Constraints
for i in range(I):
    for k in range(K):
        if i == 0:
            #### First year manpower balance
            manpower_balance = data['strength'][k] * (1 - data['moreonewaste'][k])
        else:
            #### Subsequent years manpower balance
            manpower_balance = (1 - data['lessonewaste'][k]) * x_recruit[k][i-1] + (1 - data['moreonewaste'][k]) * (current_strength[k] - x_redundancy[k][i-1])

        manpower_balance += x_recruit[k][i] + x_overman[k][i] + 0.5 * x_short[k][i]
        
        problem += manpower_balance >= data['requirement'][k][i]

        #### Constraints for overmanning and short-time working
        problem += x_overman[k][i] <= data['num_overman']
        problem += x_short[k][i] <= data['num_shortwork']
        problem += x_recruit[k][i] <= data['recruit'][k]
        
        #### Redundancy calculation
        current_strength = [data['strength'][k] for k in range(K)]
        problem += x_redundancy[k][i] == current_strength[k] + x_recruit[k][i] + x_overman[k][i] - data['requirement'][k][i]

#### Solve Problem
problem.solve()

#### Output
output = {
    "recruit": [[pulp.value(x_recruit[k][i]) for i in range(I)] for k in range(K)],
    "overmanning": [[pulp.value(x_overman[k][i]) for i in range(I)] for k in range(K)],
    "short": [[pulp.value(x_short[k][i]) for i in range(I)] for k in range(K)]
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
