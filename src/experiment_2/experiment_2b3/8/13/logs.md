PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- Consider a set \var{P} described by linear inequality constraints, that is:
 \var{P} = {\var{x} \in R^\var{N} | \var{a_i}^T x <= \var{b_i} , i = 1, ..., m}.

where \var{a_i} \in R^\var{N} and \var{b_i} \in R

- A ball with center \var{y} in R^\var{N} and radius \var{r} is defined as the set of all points within (Euclidean) distance \var{r} from \var{y}.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "A": [[a_i_j for j in 1, ..., n] for i in 1, ..., m],
    "b": [b_i for i in 1, ..., m]
}

OBJECTIVE: We are interested in finding a ball with the largest possible radius, which is entirely contained within the set \var{P} (The center of such a ball is called the Chebychev center of \var{P}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- center (list): The center of the ball as a list of floats of length \var{N}
- radius (float): The radius of the ball as a float

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "center": [y_j for j in 1, ..., n],
    "radius": r
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we'll use the Pulp library in Python to set up and solve a linear programming problem to find the Chebychev center of the set \( P \). The Chebychev center maximizes the radius of the largest ball that can be inscribed within the feasible region defined by the inequalities.

Here's how we'll approach this:
1. Define the decision variables: The center of the ball \( y \) and the radius \( r \).
2. Set up the objective function to maximize \( r \).
3. Define the constraints such that the ball with center \( y \) and radius \( r \) satisfies all the given linear inequalities.

Let's proceed to solve it using the data provided.

```python
import pulp

#### Parse the given data
data = {'M': 4, 'N': 2, 'A': [[1.0, 0.0], [-1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, -1.0]], 'B': [2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0]}
M = data['M']
N = data['N']
A = data['A']
B = data['B']

#### Create a linear programming problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Chebychev_Center", pulp.LpMaximize)

#### Decision variables
y = [pulp.LpVariable(f'y_{j}', cat='Continuous') for j in range(N)]
r = pulp.LpVariable('r', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')  #### radius r must be non-negative

#### Objective function: Maximize the radius r
problem += r

#### Constraints: Each inequality defines an inward-pointing half-space
for i in range(M):
    problem += (pulp.lpSum(A[i][j] * y[j] for j in range(N)) + r * (sum(A[i][j]**2 for j in range(N))**0.5) <= B[i])

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Get the results
center = [pulp.value(y[j]) for j in range(N)]
radius = pulp.value(r)

#### Print the results in the specified output format
output = {
    "center": center,
    "radius": radius
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```
This code sets up and solves the problem using the given data, maximizing the radius of the ball, ensuring that it lies entirely within the region defined by the constraints. It prints the center and radius of the largest inscribed ball (Chebychev center) along with the objective value.
