<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

<DATA>

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we will use Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) with the PuLP library to determine the optimal distribution of files across the minimum number of floppy disks. We define binary decision variables to indicate whether a disk is used and whether a file is placed on a particular disk.

Here's the implementation in Python using the PuLP library:

```python
import pulp

#### Parse input data
data = {'capacity': 3, 'size': [1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}
capacity = data["capacity"]
sizes = data["size"]
N = len(sizes)  #### Number of files

#### Create decision variables
#### x[i][j] = 1 if file j is placed on disk i, 0 otherwise
#### y[i] = 1 if disk i is used, 0 otherwise
max_disks = N  #### At most one disk per file initially
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("x", (range(max_disks), range(N)), cat='Binary')
y = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("y", range(max_disks), cat='Binary')

#### Define the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("FloppyDiskBackup", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Objective function: minimize the number of used disks
problem += pulp.lpSum(y[i] for i in range(max_disks))

#### Constraints
#### Each file must be placed on exactly one disk
for j in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[i][j] for i in range(max_disks)) == 1

#### The total size of files on each disk cannot exceed its capacity
for i in range(max_disks):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[i][j] * sizes[j] for j in range(N)) <= capacity * y[i]

#### Solve the problem
result = problem.solve()

#### Determine the number of disks used and which files go to which disk
whichdisk = [-1] * N
n_disks = sum(pulp.value(y[i]) for i in range(max_disks) if pulp.value(y[i]) == 1)
for j in range(N):
    for i in range(max_disks):
        if pulp.value(x[i][j]) == 1:
            whichdisk[j] = i
            break

#### Output result
output = {
    "n_disks": int(n_disks),
    "whichdisk": whichdisk
}

print(output)
print(f'(Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This code will output the minimum number of disks (`n_disks`) used and a list (`whichdisk`) indicating which disk each file is placed on. The objective value, which is the minimal number of disks used, is printed at the end.
