PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- To operate a cafeteria, the manager must ensure on-call duty based on the statistics on the required staff. 
- In the future days, the number of desired employees on day \var{n} is denoted with \var{num_{n}}.
- Each employee works \var{n_working_days} days in a row and then has \var{n_resting_days} days off.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"num": [num_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"n_working_days": n_working_days,
	"n_resting_days": n_resting_days
}


OBJECTIVE: Calculate the minimum number of employees to hire

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_number} represents the total number of employees to employ
- \var{is_work} represents whether employee is working a rest on each day. Its length is determined by \var{total_number}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"total_number": total_number,
	"is_work": [[is_work_{n, i} for n in 1,...,N] for i in 1,...,total_number]
