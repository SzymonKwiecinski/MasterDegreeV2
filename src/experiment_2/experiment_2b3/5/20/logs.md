PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- An engineering factory makes several products on the machines, and the number of machine \var{m} the factory has is \var{num_{m}}.
- Each product \var{k} yields \var{profit_{k}} to profit (defined as £/unit selling price minus cost of raw materials).
- The unit production times (hours) product \var{k} requires on machine \var{m} is \var{time_{k, m}}
- In the present month (January) and several subsequent months, certain machines will be down for maintenance.
- In month \var{i}, the number of machine \var{m} that will be down is \var{maintain_{i, m}}.
- There are marketing limitations on each product in each month. 
- The limitation of product \var{k} in month \var{i} is \var{limit_{k, i}}.
- It is possible to store up to 100 of each product at a time at a cost of \var{store_price} per unit per month. 
- There are no stocks at present, but we should have a stock of \var{keep_quantity} of each type of product at the end of subsequent months.
- The factory works six days a week with \var{n_workhours} hours each day. 
- No sequencing problems need to be considered.
- We can assume that a month has 24 days for convenience.

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
The IndexError suggests that the code is trying to access an index in the `times` or `maintenance` arrays that doesn't exist. The issue likely arises because I need to ensure that we access the correct dimensions in the nested loops.

#### Objective Value
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')

This code includes a check to ensure that we're only accessing machine `m` if it's within the bounds of the `times` matrix. The use of `len(times[0])` ensures we don't go out of bounds when accessing machine-related times.
