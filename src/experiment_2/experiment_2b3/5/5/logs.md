PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- Consider a communication network consisting of \var{n} nodes.
- Nodes are conÂ­nected by communication links.
- A link allowing one-way transmission from node \var{i} to node \var{j} is described by an ordered pair (\var{i},\var{j}). 
- Let \var{A} be the set of all links. 
- We assume that each link (\var{i},\var{j}) \in \var{A} can carry up to \var{U_{i,j}} bits per second. 
- There is a positive cost \var{C_{i,j}} per bit transmitted along that link. 
- Each node \var{k} generates data, at the rate of \var{B_{k,l}} bits per second, that have to be transmitted to node \var{l}, either through a direct link (\var{k}, \var{l}) or by tracing a sequence of links. 
- We allow the data with the same origin and destination to be split and be transmitted along different paths.

INPUT FORMAT:

        "end": j,

        }
    ]
}


OBJECTIVE: Find paths along which all data reach their intended destinations, while minimizing the total cost. 



OUTPUT INFO:
- \var{total_cost} represents the total cost of all the paths
- \var{path_cost} represents the cost of the corresponding path
- \var{path_flow} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem using the Pulp library, we define the LP problem to minimize the total cost of transmitting data across the network. We will create decision variables for the flow on each link for each data request. The solution will provide the optimal flow allocation to minimize the transmission cost while respecting the link capacities.

Let's start by translating the problem into a PuLP model.

```python
import pulp

#### Parsing the data
data = {
    'NumLinks': 4,
    'StartNode': [1, 2, 2, 3],
    'EndNode': [2, 3, 4, 4],
    'Capacity': [50, 40, 60, 50],
    'Cost': [2, 3, 1, 1],
    'NumFlowReqs': 2,
    'Source': [1, 2],
    'Destination': [4, 3],
    'DataRate': [40, 30]
}

#### Variables for convenience
links = [(data['StartNode'][i], data['EndNode'][i]) for i in range(data['NumLinks'])]
capacities = {links[i]: data['Capacity'][i] for i in range(data['NumLinks'])}
costs = {links[i]: data['Cost'][i] for i in range(data['NumLinks'])}
flow_reqs = [(data['Source'][i], data['Destination'][i], data['DataRate'][i]) for i in range(data['NumFlowReqs'])]

#### Initialize the Linear Programming problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Cost", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Define the decision variables
flow_vars = {}
for req in flow_reqs:
    k, l, rate = req
    for (i, j) in links:
        flow_vars[(k, l, i, j)] = pulp.LpVariable(f'flow_{k}_{l}_{i}_{j}', 0)

#### Objective function: Minimize the total cost
problem += pulp.lpSum(costs[(i, j)] * flow_vars[(k, l, i, j)] for (k, l, rate) in flow_reqs for (i, j) in links)

#### Constraints: Capacity constraints for each link
for (i, j) in links:
    problem += pulp.lpSum(flow_vars[(k, l, i, j)] for (k, l, rate) in flow_reqs) <= capacities[(i, j)]

#### Constraints: Flow conservation
for (k, l, rate) in flow_reqs:
    for node in set(data['StartNode'] + data['EndNode']):
        if node == k:
            problem += pulp.lpSum(flow_vars[(k, l, node, j)] for j in set(data['EndNode']) if (node, j) in links) - \
                       pulp.lpSum(flow_vars[(k, l, i, node)] for i in set(data['StartNode']) if (i, node) in links) == rate
        elif node == l:
            problem += pulp.lpSum(flow_vars[(k, l, node, j)] for j in set(data['EndNode']) if (node, j) in links) - \
                       pulp.lpSum(flow_vars[(k, l, i, node)] for i in set(data['StartNode']) if (i, node) in links) == -rate
        else:
            problem += pulp.lpSum(flow_vars[(k, l, node, j)] for j in set(data['EndNode']) if (node, j) in links) - \
                       pulp.lpSum(flow_vars[(k, l, i, node)] for i in set(data['StartNode']) if (i, node) in links) == 0

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract results
optimized_paths = {"paths": [], "total_cost": pulp.value(problem.objective)}

for (k, l, rate) in flow_reqs:
    for (i, j) in links:
        flow_value = flow_vars[(k, l, i, j)].varValue
        if flow_value > 0:
            path_cost = flow_value * costs[(i, j)]
            optimized_paths["paths"].append({
                "source": k,
                "destination": l,
                "route": [i, j],
                "path_flow": flow_value,
                "path_cost": path_cost
            })

print(optimized_paths)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```
