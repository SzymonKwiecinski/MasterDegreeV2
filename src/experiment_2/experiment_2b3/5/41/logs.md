<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

## START MESSAGE 1 
### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve the given problem using Pulp library, we'll create a mixed-integer linear programming model. We'll define binary variables to determine which files are on which disks, and minimize the number of disks used. Here's the solution:

```python
import pulp

#### Parse the data
data = {'capacity': 3, 'size': [1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}
capacity = data['capacity']
sizes = data['size']
num_files = len(sizes)

#### Create a problem variable
problem = pulp.LpProblem("FloppyDiskBackup", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
#### x[i][j] = 1 if file j is assigned to disk i, else 0
max_disks = num_files  #### upper bound on the number of disks needed
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("x", ((i, j) for i in range(max_disks) for j in range(num_files)), cat='Binary')

#### y[i] = 1 if disk i is used, else 0
y = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("y", (i for i in range(max_disks)), cat='Binary')

#### Objective function: minimize the number of disks used
problem += pulp.lpSum(y[i] for i in range(max_disks))

#### Constraints
#### Each file must be assigned to exactly one disk
for j in range(num_files):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[i, j] for i in range(max_disks)) == 1

#### The total size of files on each disk cannot exceed the disk capacity
for i in range(max_disks):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(sizes[j] * x[i, j] for j in range(num_files)) <= capacity * y[i]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract results
n_disks = sum(y[i].varValue for i in range(max_disks))
whichdisk = [-1] * num_files
for j in range(num_files):
    for i in range(max_disks):
        if pulp.value(x[(i, j)]) == 1:
            whichdisk[j] = i
            break

results = {
    "n_disks": int(n_disks),
    "whichdisk": whichdisk
}

print(results)
print(f" (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>")
```

This code will distribute the files across the floppy disks in a way that minimizes the number of disks used, and provides the mapping of files to disks in the `whichdisk` list.
