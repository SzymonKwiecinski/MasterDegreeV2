PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
        for id in 1, ..., m
    ],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this transportation problem using Linear Programming with the PuLP library, we'll define a linear optimization problem where the objective is to minimize the total transportation cost while satisfying the demands and supply constraints.

Let's translate the given problem into a PuLP model:

```python
import pulp

#### Given data
data = {
    'NumTerminals': 3,
    'NumDestinations': 4,
    'Cost': [
        [34, 49, 17, 26],
        [52, 64, 23, 14],
        [20, 28, 12, 17]
    ],
    'Demand': [65, 70, 50, 45],
    'Supply': [150, 100, 100]
}

#### Problem setup
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Transportation_Cost", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Variables: quantity shipped from terminal i to destination j
#### x[i][j] represents the amount shipped from terminal i to destination j
x = [[pulp.LpVariable(f'x_{i}_{j}', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous') for j in range(data['NumDestinations'])] for i in range(data['NumTerminals'])]

#### Objective function: Minimize the total transportation cost
problem += pulp.lpSum(data['Cost'][i][j] * x[i][j] for i in range(data['NumTerminals']) for j in range(data['NumDestinations']))

#### Supply constraints: The total amount shipped from each terminal should not exceed its supply
for i in range(data['NumTerminals']):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[i][j] for j in range(data['NumDestinations'])) <= data['Supply'][i]

#### Demand constraints: Demand at each destination must be met
for j in range(data['NumDestinations']):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[i][j] for i in range(data['NumTerminals'])) >= data['Demand'][j]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Output the results
distribution = [{'from': i, 'to': j, 'amount': pulp.value(x[i][j])} for i in range(data['NumTerminals']) for j in range(data['NumDestinations'])]
total_cost = pulp.value(problem.objective)

#### Output format
output = {
    "distribution": distribution,
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{total_cost}</OBJ>')
```

This code sets up the linear programming problem with the given constraints and solves it using PuLP. After solving the problem, it outputs the distribution of soybean shipments from terminals to destinations, along with the minimized total cost.
