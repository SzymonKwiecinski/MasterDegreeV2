<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

## START MESSAGE 1 
### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem using the Pulp library, we will define a MILP model to minimize the number of floppy disks required. We will set up binary variables indicating whether a file is allocated to a specific disk and whether a disk is used. Here's the code:

```python
import pulp

#### Parse the JSON data
data = {'capacity': 3, 'size': [1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}

#### Extract the inputs
capacity = data['capacity']
sizes = data['size']
N = len(sizes)  #### number of files

#### Maximum number of disks needed is at worst each file on a separate disk
max_disks = N

#### Create the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Floppy_Disks", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
#### y_d is 1 if disk d is used
y = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("disk_used", range(max_disks), cat='Binary')
#### x_jd is 1 if file j is on disk d
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("file_on_disk", [(j, d) for j in range(N) for d in range(max_disks)], cat='Binary')

#### Objective: Minimize the number of disks used
problem += pulp.lpSum([y[d] for d in range(max_disks)])

#### Constraints
#### Each file must be placed on exactly one disk
for j in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum([x[(j, d)] for d in range(max_disks)]) == 1

#### The sum of sizes of files on each disk must not exceed the capacity of a disk
for d in range(max_disks):
    problem += pulp.lpSum([sizes[j] * x[(j, d)] for j in range(N)]) <= capacity * y[d]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract output data structure
n_disks = int(sum([pulp.value(y[d]) for d in range(max_disks)]))
whichdisk = [next(d for d in range(max_disks) if pulp.value(x[(j, d)]) == 1) for j in range(N)]

output = {
    "n_disks": n_disks,
    "whichdisk": whichdisk
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This code sets up a mixed-integer linear programming problem, defining binary decision variables for file allocation on disks and for whether a disk is used. The constraints ensure each file is placed on exactly one disk and that the total size of files on any disk does not exceed its capacity. Then, it solves the problem and outputs the number of disks used and the assignment of files to disks.
