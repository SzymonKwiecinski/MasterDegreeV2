<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
        for id in 1, ..., m
    ],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

#### Data from JSON
data = {
    'NumTerminals': 3,
    'NumDestinations': 4,
    'Cost': [
        [34, 49, 17, 26],
        [52, 64, 23, 14],
        [20, 28, 12, 17]
    ],
    'Demand': [65, 70, 50, 45],
    'Supply': [150, 100, 100]
}

#### Problem definition
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Soybean_Transportation", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Sets
terminals = range(data['NumTerminals'])
destinations = range(data['NumDestinations'])

#### Decision Variables
amount = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("amount",
                               ((i, j) for i in terminals for j in destinations),
                               lowBound=0,
                               cat='Continuous')

#### Objective Function
problem += pulp.lpSum(data['Cost'][i][j] * amount[i, j] for i in terminals for j in destinations)

#### Constraints for Supply Limits
for i in terminals:
    problem += pulp.lpSum(amount[i, j] for j in destinations) <= data['Supply'][i], f"Supply_{i}"

#### Constraints for Demand Fulfillment
for j in destinations:
    problem += pulp.lpSum(amount[i, j] for i in terminals) >= data['Demand'][j], f"Demand_{j}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extracting results
distribution = [
    {
        "from": i,
        "to": j,
        "amount": pulp.value(amount[i, j])
    }
