PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- Consider a set \var{P} described by linear inequality constraints, that is:
 \var{P} = {\var{x} \in R^\var{N} | \var{a_i}^T x <= \var{b_i} , i = 1, ..., m}.

where \var{a_i} \in R^\var{N} and \var{b_i} \in R

- A ball with center \var{y} in R^\var{N} and radius \var{r} is defined as the set of all points within (Euclidean) distance \var{r} from \var{y}.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "A": [[a_i_j for j in 1, ..., n] for i in 1, ..., m],
    "b": [b_i for i in 1, ..., m]
}

OBJECTIVE: We are interested in finding a ball with the largest possible radius, which is entirely contained within the set \var{P} (The center of such a ball is called the Chebychev center of \var{P}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- center (list): The center of the ball as a list of floats of length \var{N}
- radius (float): The radius of the ball as a float

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "center": [y_j for j in 1, ..., n],
    "radius": r
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve the problem of finding the Chebychev center of the set described by linear inequalities, we can utilize linear programming. We'll need to set up the problem such that the objective is to maximize the radius `r` of the ball, subject to the constraint that the ball is completely contained within the polytope defined by the inequalities.

Let's set up the problem using the Pulp library in Python:

```python
import pulp

#### Data
data = {'M': 4, 'N': 2, 'A': [[1.0, 0.0], [-1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, -1.0]], 'B': [2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0]}

M = data['M']
N = data['N']
A = data['A']
b = data['B']

#### Problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Chebyshev_Center", pulp.LpMaximize)

#### Variables
center = [pulp.LpVariable(f'y_{j}', lowBound=None) for j in range(N)]
radius = pulp.LpVariable('r', lowBound=0)

#### Objective: Maximize the radius r
problem += radius, "Maximize_Radius"

#### Constraints: Ensure the ball is contained within the polytope
for i in range(M):
    problem += (pulp.lpSum(A[i][j] * center[j] for j in range(N)) + radius * (sum(A[i][j]**2 for j in range(N))**0.5) <= b[i]), f"Constraint_{i}"

#### Solve
problem.solve()

#### Output
center_solution = [pulp.value(center[j]) for j in range(N)]
radius_solution = pulp.value(radius)

output = {
    "center": center_solution,
    "radius": radius_solution
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This code sets up an LP problem to find the Chebychev center of the polytope defined by the inequalities in matrix \( A \) and vector \( b \). The radius of the largest ball contained in the polytope is maximized, ensuring that the ball remains within the polytope using the provided constraints.
