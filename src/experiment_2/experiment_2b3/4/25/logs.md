<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- An economy consists of several industries. 
- Each unit produced by one of the industries (a unit will be taken as £1’s worth of value of production) requires inputs from possibly its own industry as well as other industries. 
- Industry \var{k} requires \var{inputone_{k, j}} input from industy \var{j}.
- Industry \var{k} requires \var{manpowerone_{k}} units of manpower.
- There is a time lag in the economy so that the output in year t + 1 requires an input in year t.
- Output from an industry may also be used to build productive capacity for itself or other industries in future years.
- To give unit increases (capacity for £1’s worth of extra production) in productive capacity of industry \var{k}, \var{j} units of industry \var{inputtwo_{k, j}} and \var{manpowertwo{k}} units of manpower are needed.
- Input from an industry in year t results in a (permanent) increase in productive capacity in year t + 2.
- Stocks of goods may be held from year to year. 
- At present (year 0), the stocks of industry \var{k} is \var{stock_{k}}, and the capacity of industry \var{k} is \var{capacity_{k}}.
- There is a limited yearly manpower capacity of \var{manpower_limit}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "inputone": [[inputone_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
    "manpowerone": [manpowerone_{k} for k in 1,...,K],

    "stock": [stock_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "capacity": [capacity_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "manpower_limit": manpower_limit,
}


OBJECTIVE: Maximize total production in the last two years.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{produce} represents the amount of units produced by each industry in each year
- \var{buildcapa} represents the amount of units used to build productive capacity for each industry in each year
- \var{stockhold} represents the amount of stock of each industry held in each year
