Python code place between ```python and ```. You receive the data in json format between: <DATA></DATA>. Do not change data format! Do not use `while` loop in python code! Do not include 'pip install' in script. Assume every python package is installed Print at the end the objective between <OBJ></OBJ> `print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')`

PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- An investor has a portfolio of \var{N} different stocks.
- He has bought \var{bought_i} shares of stock \var{i} at price \var{buyPrice_i}. 
- The current price of one share of stock \var{i} is \var{currentPrice_i}.
- The investor expects that the price of one share of stock \var{i} in one year will be \var{futurePrice_i}.
- If he sells shares, the investor pays transaction costs at the rate of \var{transactionRate} % of the amount transacted.
- In addition, the investor pays taxes at the rate of \var{taxRate} % on capital gains (i.e., the difference between the amount received from selling shares and the amount paid to buy them).
- Both transaction costs and taxes are numbers between 0 and 100.
- The investor wants to raise an amount of money \var{K} net of capital gains and transaction costs.
- You can assume that the investor can sell floating point numbers of shares.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "bought": [bought_i, for i in 1, ..., N],
    "buyPrice": [buyPrice_i, for i in 1, ..., N],
    "currentPrice": [currentPrice_i, for i in 1, ..., N],
    "futurePrice": [futurePrice_i, for i in 1, ..., N],
    "transactionRate": transactionRate,
    "taxRate": taxRate,
    "K": K
}

OBJECTIVE: We want to know how many shares the investor needs to sell in order to raise the needed money, net of capital gains and transaction costs, while maximizing the expected value of his portfolio next year.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{sell_i} is the number of shares of stock \var{i} that the investor should sell.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "sell": [sell_i, for i in 1, ..., N],
}

}

#### Variables
N = data['N']
bought = data['Bought']
buy_price = data['BuyPrice']
current_price = data['CurrentPrice']
future_price = data['FuturePrice']
transaction_rate = data['TransactionRate'] / 100
tax_rate = data['TaxRate'] / 100
K = data['K']

#### Problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Maximize_Future_Portfolio_Value", pulp.LpMaximize)

#### Decision Variables
sell = [pulp.LpVariable(f'sell_{i}', lowBound=0) for i in range(N)]

#### Objective Function
future_value = pulp.lpSum((bought[i] - sell[i]) * future_price[i] for i in range(N))
problem += future_value

#### Constraints
net_proceeds = pulp.lpSum(sell[i] * current_price[i] for i in range(N))
transaction_costs = pulp.lpSum(sell[i] * current_price[i] * transaction_rate for i in range(N))
capital_gains = pulp.lpSum(sell[i] * (current_price[i] - buy_price[i]) for i in range(N))
taxes = capital_gains * tax_rate

problem += (net_proceeds - transaction_costs - taxes >= K)

#### Solve
problem.solve()

#### Output Solution
sell_output = [sell[i].varValue for i in range(N)]
