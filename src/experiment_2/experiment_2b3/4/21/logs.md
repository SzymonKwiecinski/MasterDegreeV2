PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- An engineering factory makes several products on the machines, and the number of machine \var{m} the factory has is \var{num_{m}}.
- Each product \var{k} yields \var{profit_{k}} to profit (defined as £/unit selling price minus cost of raw materials).
- The unit production times (hours) product \var{k} requires on machine \var{m} is \var{time_{k, m}}
- In the present month (January) and several subsequent months, certain machines will be down for maintenance.
- Each machine \var{m} has to be down for \var{down_{m}} months for maintenance.
- There are marketing limitations on each product in each month. 
- The limitation of product \var{k} in month \var{i} is \var{limit_{k, i}}.
- It is possible to store up to 100 of each product at a time at a cost of \var{store_price} per unit per month. 
- There are no stocks at present, but it is desired to have a stock of \var{keep_quantity} of each type of product at the end of subsequent months.
- The factory works a six days a week with two shifts of \var{n_workhours} hours each day. 
- No sequencing problems need to be considered.
- We can assume that a month has 24 days for convenience.

for i in range(I):
    for m in range(M):
        working_hours = num_machines[m] * 6 * n_workhours * 24 - maintain[m, k] * n_workhours  #### Corrected indexing here
        problem += pulp.lpSum(time[k][m] * manufacture[k, i] for k in range(K)) <= working_hours

#### Machine maintenance constraints
for m in range(M):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(maintain[m, k] for k in range(I)) >= down[m]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract solution values
sell_values = [[pulp.value(sell[k, i]) for i in range(I)] for k in range(K)]
manufacture_values = [[pulp.value(manufacture[k, i]) for i in range(I)] for k in range(K)]
storage_values = [[pulp.value(storage[k, i]) for i in range(I)] for k in range(K)]
maintain_values = [[pulp.value(maintain[m, k]) for m in range(M)] for k in range(K)]

#### Output format
solution = {
    "sell": sell_values,
    "manufacture": manufacture_values,
    "storage": storage_values,
    "maintain": maintain_values
}

#### Print the solution and objective
print(solution)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

In this corrected code, I made sure to check the indexing in the time constraint loop and corrected the incorrect index usage. The machine maintenance variable should be expressed correctly in relation to the machine and month it's being applied to.
