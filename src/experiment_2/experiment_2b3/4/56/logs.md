PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem using the Pulp library, we need to formulate the problem as a linear programming problem. We'll define binary decision variables for each choice at each intersection, such that the delivery person will either move west or north. The objective is to minimize the total walking time from the starting point to the destination.

Here's how we can set this up:

1. Define decision variables for moving north and west.
2. Set up constraints to ensure the path follows valid intersections.
3. Minimize the total travel time using the given west and north times.

Let's translate this into code:

```python
import pulp

#### Input data
data = {'west_time': [[3.5, 4.5], [4, 4], [5, 4]], 'north_time': [[10, 10, 9], [9, 9, 12]]}

west_time = data['west_time']
north_time = data['north_time']

N = len(north_time) + 1
W = len(west_time[0]) + 1

#### Initialize LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Delivery_Time_Minimization", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
move_west = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("Move_West", (range(N), range(W - 1)), 0, 1, pulp.LpBinary)
move_north = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("Move_North", (range(N - 1), range(W)), 0, 1, pulp.LpBinary)

#### Objective function
problem += pulp.lpSum([
    west_time[n][w] * move_west[n][w] for n in range(N) for w in range(W - 1)
]) + pulp.lpSum([
    north_time[n][w] * move_north[n][w] for n in range(N - 1) for w in range(W)
])

#### Constraints

#### Start at (0, 0)
problem += move_west[0][0] + move_north[0][0] == 1

#### Ensuring path continuity
for n in range(N):
    for w in range(W):
        if n > 0:
            problem += move_north[n - 1][w] + (move_west[n][w - 1] if w > 0 else 0) >= (move_west[n][w] if w < W - 1 else 0) + (move_north[n][w] if n < N - 1 else 0)

for n in range(N):
    #### Can't go north from last row
    if n == N - 1:
        for w in range(W):
            problem += move_north[n - 1][w] == (move_west[n][w] if w < W - 1 else 0)
            
    #### Can't go west from last column
    if n < N - 1:
        problem += move_west[n][W - 2] == move_north[n][W - 1]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract results
paths = []
for n in range(N):
    for w in range(W):
        if w < W - 1 and pulp.value(move_west[n][w]) == 1:
            paths.append((n+1, w+2))  #### Order of stepping
        if n < N - 1 and pulp.value(move_north[n][w]) == 1:
            paths.append((n+2, w+1))

total_time = pulp.value(problem.objective)

#### Output result
output = {
    "paths": paths,
    "total_time": total_time
}
print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

In this code:
- We defined a binary decision variable for each possible move at each intersection.
- We constructed the objective function to minimize total travel time.
- We added constraints to ensure valid movements.
- The solution is extracted from the LP variables and printed, showing the optimal path and total time.
