<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- A state wants to plan its electricity capacity for the next \var{T} years. 
- The state has a forecast of \var{demand_t} megawatts, presumed accurate, of the demand for electricity during year \var{t}.
- The existing capacity, which is in oil-fired plants, that will not be retired and will be available during year \var{t}, is \var{oil_t}.
- There are two alternatives for expanding electric capacity: coal­ fired or nuclear power plants.
- There is a capital cost of \var{coal_cost} per megawatt of coal-fired capacity that becomes operational at the beginning of year \var{t}.
- There is a capital cost of \var{nuke_cost} per megawatt of nuclear power capacity that becomes operational at the beginning of year \var{t}.
- For various political and safety reasons, it has been decided that no more than \var{max_nuke}% of the total capacity should ever be nuclear (\var{max_nuke} is a number between 0 and 100).
- Coal plants last for \var{coal_life} years, while nuclear plants last for \var{nuke_life} years.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "demand": [demand_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "oil_cap": [oil_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "coal_cost": coal_cost,
    "nuke_cost": nuke_cost,
    "max_nuke": max_nuke,
    "coal_life": coal_life,
    "nuke_life": nuke_life,
}


OBJECTIVE: What is the capacity expansion plan that results in the minimum cost?


OUTPUT INFO:

- the output should represent how much coal and nuclear capacity should be added in each year, and how much the total cost is.
- the output should be a dictionary with three keys: "coal_cap_added", "nuke_cap_added", and "total_cost".
- the value of "coal_cap_added" should be a list of the coal capacity added in each year.
- the value of "nuke_cap_added" should be a list of the nuclear capacity added in each year.
- the value of "total_cost" should be a single floating point number showing the total cost of the system.


OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "coal_cap_added": [coal_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "nuke_cap_added": [nuke_t for t in 1, ..., T],
