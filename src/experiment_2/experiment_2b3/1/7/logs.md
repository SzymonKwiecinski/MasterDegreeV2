<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "x_0": x_0,
    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,
    "T": T
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is max_t |a_t|. 

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "fuel_spend" contains the total fuel spent by the rocket

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "v": [v_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "a": [a_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "fuel_spend": fuel_spent,

```python

#### Read input data
data = {'X0': 0, 'V0': 0, 'XT': 1, 'VT': 0, 'T': 20}

x_0 = data['X0']
v_0 = data['V0']
x_T = data['XT']
v_T = data['VT']
T = data['T']

#### Define the LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("RocketProblem", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
x = [pulp.LpVariable(f'x_{t}', cat='Continuous') for t in range(T + 1)]
v = [pulp.LpVariable(f'v_{t}', cat='Continuous') for t in range(T + 1)]
a = [pulp.LpVariable(f'a_{t}', cat='Continuous') for t in range(T)]
thrust_max = pulp.LpVariable('thrust_max', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')

#### Objective: Minimize the max thrust
problem += thrust_max

#### Initial conditions
problem += (x[0] == x_0)
problem += (v[0] == v_0)

#### Target conditions
problem += (x[T] == x_T)
problem += (v[T] == v_T)

#### Dynamics constraints
for t in range(T):
    problem += (x[t + 1] == x[t] + v[t])
    problem += (v[t + 1] == v[t] + a[t])
    problem += (a[t] <= thrust_max)
    problem += (-a[t] <= thrust_max)

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract results
x_values = [x[i].varValue for i in range(1, T + 1)]
v_values = [v[i].varValue for i in range(1, T + 1)]
a_values = [a[i].varValue for i in range(T)]
fuel_spent = sum(abs(a[i].varValue) for i in range(T))

#### Output format
output = {
