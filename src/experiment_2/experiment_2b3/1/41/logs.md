<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we will employ a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach utilizing the PuLP library in Python. We aim to minimize the number of floppy disks used while ensuring that the sum of file sizes on each disk does not exceed the disk's capacity.

Here's the solution using PuLP:

```python
import pulp

#### Data from the input
data = {'capacity': 3, 'size': [1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}

#### Parameters
capacity = data['capacity']
file_sizes = data['size']
N = len(file_sizes)  #### Number of files

#### Estimating the maximum number of disks needed
max_disks = N

#### Problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("MinimizeFloppyDisks", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Variables
#### x[i][j] = 1 if file i is on disk j
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("x", ((i, j) for i in range(N) for j in range(max_disks)), cat='Binary')

#### y[j] = 1 if disk j is used
y = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("y", (j for j in range(max_disks)), cat='Binary')

#### Objective function: Minimize the number of disks used
problem += pulp.lpSum([y[j] for j in range(max_disks)])

#### Constraints
#### Each file must be on exactly one disk
for i in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum([x[i, j] for j in range(max_disks)]) == 1

#### Capacity constraint for each disk
for j in range(max_disks):
    problem += pulp.lpSum([file_sizes[i] * x[i, j] for i in range(N)]) <= capacity * y[j]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Determine the number of disks used and the disk distribution
n_disks = sum(pulp.value(y[j]) for j in range(max_disks))
whichdisk = [None] * N

for i in range(N):
    for j in range(max_disks):
        if pulp.value(x[i, j]) == 1:
            whichdisk[i] = j
            break

output = {
    "n_disks": int(n_disks),
    "whichdisk": whichdisk
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

Explanation:
- We define a binary variable `x[i, j]` which is 1 if file `i` is placed on disk `j`. 
- Another binary variable `y[j]` indicates whether disk `j` is used.
- The objective is to minimize the sum of `y[j]`, which corresponds to the number of disks used.
- The constraints ensure each file is placed on exactly one disk, and the total size of files on each disk does not exceed its capacity.
- The solution provides the number of disks used and the specific disk each file is placed on.
