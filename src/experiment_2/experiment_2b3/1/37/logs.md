<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A small firm specializes in making some types of spare automobile parts. 
- Each part is has to go through several shops 
- The required worker-hours for part \var{k} in shop \var{s} is \var{time_{k, s}}.
- The profit of part \var{k} is \var{profit_{k}}.
- The capacity of shop \var{s} is \var{capacity_{s}} working hours.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"time": [[time_{k, s} for s in 1,...,S] for k in 1,...,K],
	"profit": [profit_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
	"capacity": [capacity_{s} for s in 1,...,S]
}


OBJECTIVE: Formulate the problem of determining the quantities of each spare part to be made during the month so as to maximize profit.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{quantity} represents the amount of each spare part to be made

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"quantity": [quantity_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}
