<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A quantity y is known to depend on another quantity x. A set of corresponding values has been collected for x and y and is presented.
- The \var{k}-th y value takes \var{y_{k}} and the \var{k}-th x value takes \var{x_{k}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "y": [y_{k} for k = 1,...,K],
    "x": [x_{k} for k = 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Fit the ‘best’ straight line y = bx + a where the objective is to minimize the maximum deviation of all the observed values of y from the value predicted by the linear relationship.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{intercept} represents the intercept of the fitted line
- \var{slope} represents the slope of the fitted line

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve the problem of fitting the best straight line \( y = bx + a \) that minimizes the maximum deviation from observed values using Linear Programming, we can use the PuLP library in Python. Here's how you can implement this:

```python
import pulp

#### Data
data = {
    "NumObs": 19,
    "Y": [1.0, 0.9, 0.7, 1.5, 2.0, 2.4, 3.2, 2.0, 2.7, 3.5, 1.0, 4.0, 3.6, 2.7, 5.7, 4.6, 6.0, 6.8, 7.3],
    "X": [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 1.9, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.6, 7.0, 7.6, 8.5, 9.0, 10.0]
}

#### Variables
Y = data['Y']
X = data['X']
num_obs = data['NumObs']

#### Define the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("BestFitLine_MinMaxDeviation", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
a = pulp.LpVariable('a', lowBound=None, upBound=None)
b = pulp.LpVariable('b', lowBound=None, upBound=None)
d = pulp.LpVariable('d', lowBound=0)  #### Maximum deviation

#### Objective function
problem += d, "Minimize_Maximum_Deviation"

#### Constraints
for i in range(num_obs):
    problem += (Y[i] - (a + b * X[i]) <= d), f"Upper_Deviation_Constraint_{i}"
    problem += ((a + b * X[i]) - Y[i] <= d), f"Lower_Deviation_Constraint_{i}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract results
intercept = pulp.value(a)
slope = pulp.value(b)

#### Output the results
output = {
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This code defines the linear programming problem to fit the best straight line minimizing the maximum deviation from observed values. We set up constraints to ensure that the deviation from each observed value does not exceed \( d \). The objective is to minimize \( d \), the maximum deviation.
