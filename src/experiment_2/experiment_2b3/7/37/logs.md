Background: You are a expert at Operations Research and Linear Programming and Python. Based on description you solve given problem using Pulp python library. Python code place between ```python and ```. You receive the data in json format between: <DATA></DATA>. Do not change data format! Do not use `while` loop in python code! Do not include 'pip install' in script. Assume every python package is installed Print at the end the objective between <OBJ></OBJ> `print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')`

### ROLE: Role.USER
<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A small firm specializes in making some types of spare automobile parts. 
- Each part is has to go through several shops 
- The required worker-hours for part \var{k} in shop \var{s} is \var{time_{k, s}}.
- The profit of part \var{k} is \var{profit_{k}}.
- The capacity of shop \var{s} is \var{capacity_{s}} working hours.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"time": [[time_{k, s} for s in 1,...,S] for k in 1,...,K],
	"profit": [profit_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
	"capacity": [capacity_{s} for s in 1,...,S]
}


OBJECTIVE: Formulate the problem of determining the quantities of each spare part to be made during the month so as to maximize profit.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{quantity} represents the amount of each spare part to be made

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"quantity": [quantity_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}

<DATA>
{'time': [[2, 3], [1, 2], [3, 2], [3, 1], [1, 1]], 'profit': [30, 20, 40, 25, 10], 'capacity': [700, 1000]}</DATA>

#### Input Data
data = {'time': [[2, 3], [1, 2], [3, 2], [3, 1], [1, 1]], 
        'profit': [30, 20, 40, 25, 10], 
        'capacity': [700, 1000]}

time = data['time']
profit = data['profit']
capacity = data['capacity']

K = len(profit)  #### Number of spare parts
S = len(capacity)  #### Number of shops

#### Define the Linear Programming problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Maximize_Profit", pulp.LpMaximize)

#### Define the decision variables
quantity = [pulp.LpVariable(f'quantity_{k}', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous') for k in range(K)]

#### Objective function: Maximize total profit
problem += pulp.lpSum(profit[k] * quantity[k] for k in range(K)), "Total_Profit"

#### Constraints: Capacity of each shop
for s in range(S):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(time[k][s] * quantity[k] for k in range(K)) <= capacity[s], f"Capacity_Constraint_Shop_{s}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Output the results
output = {
    "quantity": [pulp.value(quantity[k]) for k in range(K)]
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
