PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we will employ the Pulp library to create a linear programming model. The goal is to minimize the total travel time while adhering to movement constraints on the grid.

```python
import pulp

#### Parse the input data
data = {'west_time': [[3.5, 4.5], [4, 4], [5, 4]], 'north_time': [[10, 10, 9], [9, 9, 12]]}

#### Extract grid dimensions
west_time = data['west_time']
north_time = data['north_time']
N = len(west_time)
W = len(west_time[0]) + 1

#### Initialize the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Optimal_Delivery_Path", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Variables: x_n_w: flow through the path at (n, w)
x_vars = {(n, w): pulp.LpVariable(f"x_{n}_{w}", cat="Binary") for n in range(N) for w in range(W)}

#### Objective function: Minimize total travel time
problem += pulp.lpSum([
    west_time[n][w] * x_vars[n, w+1] + north_time[n][w] * x_vars[n+1, w]
    for n in range(N) for w in range(W - 1)
    if n < N-1 and w < W
]), "Total_Travel_Time"

#### Constraint: Start at (0, 0)
problem += x_vars[0, 0] == 1, "Start_Constraint"

#### Constraint: End at (N-1, W-1)
problem += x_vars[N-1, W-1] == 1, "End_Constraint"

#### Constraints: Flow conservation
for n in range(N):
    for w in range(W):
        if n == 0 and w == 0:
            continue
        elif n == N-1 and w == W-1:
            continue
        in_flow = (x_vars[n-1, w] if n > 0 else 0) + (x_vars[n, w-1] if w > 0 else 0)
        out_flow = (x_vars[n+1, w] if n < N-1 else 0) + (x_vars[n, w+1] if w < W-1 else 0)
        problem += in_flow == out_flow, f"Flow_Conservation_{n}_{w}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve(pulp.PULP_CBC_CMD(msg=0))

#### Extract the paths
paths = [(n, w) for n in range(N) for w in range(W) if pulp.value(x_vars[n, w]) > 0.5]

#### Calculate the total time
total_time = sum(
    west_time[n][w] * pulp.value(x_vars[n, w+1]) + north_time[n][w] * pulp.value(x_vars[n+1, w])
    for n in range(N) for w in range(W - 1)
    if n < N-1 and w < W
)

#### Output result
result = {
    "paths": paths,
    "total_time": total_time
}

print(result)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This code sets up a binary variable for each potential path through the grid. The objective function minimizes the total travel time by considering both westward and northward movements. Constraints are added to ensure that the delivery person starts at the starting point and ends at the destination, while also maintaining flow conservation through the grid. The result includes the chosen path and the total time taken to complete the journey.
