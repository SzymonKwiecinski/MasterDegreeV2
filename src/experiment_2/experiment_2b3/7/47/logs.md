PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- The town has \var{S} different shifts for the police officers during the day.
- During each shift \var{s}, the town requires \var{officers_needed_{s}} police officers on duty.
- Each police officer works for two consecutive shifts.
- The cost for the town when starting a shift at \var{s} is \var{shift_cost_{s}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "officers_needed": [officers_needed_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "shift_costs": [shift_cost_{s} for s in 1, ..., S]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many officers should the town assign to each shift in order to minimize the total cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- The number of officers assigned to each shift \var{officers_assigned_{s}}.
- \var{total_cost} indicates the total cost for the town.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "officers_assigned": [officers_assigned_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

## START MESSAGE 1 
### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many police officers should be assigned to each shift to minimize the total cost, given that each officer works for two consecutive shifts.

Here's how you can solve this using the Pulp python library:

```python
import pulp

#### Data input
data = {'NumShifts': 6, 'OfficersNeeded': [15, 13, 11, 11, 9, 7], 'ShiftCosts': [500, 480, 450, 460, 470, 490]}
num_shifts = data['NumShifts']
officers_needed = data['OfficersNeeded']
shift_costs = data['ShiftCosts']

#### Create the Linear Programming Problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Officer_Costs", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
officers_assigned = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("OfficersAssigned", range(num_shifts), lowBound=0, cat='Integer')

#### Objective function: Minimize total cost
problem += pulp.lpSum([officers_assigned[i] * shift_costs[i] for i in range(num_shifts)])

#### Constraints: Meet the required number of officers for each shift
for i in range(num_shifts):
    problem += officers_assigned[i] + officers_assigned[(i + 1) % num_shifts] >= officers_needed[i]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Prepare the output
output = {
    "officers_assigned": [pulp.value(officers_assigned[i]) for i in range(num_shifts)],
    "total_cost": pulp.value(problem.objective)
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This code sets up the linear programming problem using the Pulp library. It defines decision variables for the number of officers assigned to each shift, the objective function to minimize costs, and constraints to ensure each shift's officer needs are met. After solving the problem, it prints the assignment of officers to each shift and the total cost.
