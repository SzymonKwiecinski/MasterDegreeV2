<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

<DATA>
{'capacity': 3, 'size': [1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}</DATA>

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem using the Pulp Python library, we will formulate it as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem.

```python
import pulp

#### Input data
data = {'capacity': 3, 'size': [1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}

#### Extracting capacity and sizes
capacity = data['capacity']
sizes = data['size']
N = len(sizes)

#### Define the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Floppy_Disk_Backup", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
#### y[i] indicates if disk i is used
y = [pulp.LpVariable(f'y_{i}', cat='Binary') for i in range(N)]
#### x[j][i] indicates if file j is stored in disk i
x = [[pulp.LpVariable(f'x_{j}_{i}', cat='Binary') for i in range(N)] for j in range(N)]

#### Objective Function: Minimize the number of disks used
problem += pulp.lpSum(y[i] for i in range(N))

#### Constraints
#### Each file must be stored in exactly one disk
for j in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[j][i] for i in range(N)) == 1

#### The total size of files on each disk should not exceed its capacity
for i in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(sizes[j] * x[j][i] for j in range(N)) <= capacity * y[i]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Retrieve results
n_disks = int(sum(y[i].varValue for i in range(N)))
whichdisk = [None] * N

for j in range(N):
    for i in range(N):
        if pulp.value(x[j][i]) == 1:
            whichdisk[j] = i + 1  #### Assuming disk indexing starts from 1

#### Output format
output = {
    "n_disks": n_disks,
    "whichdisk": whichdisk
}

print(output)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

This code sets up and solves a MILP problem to determine the optimal way to distribute files across disks with a given capacity, minimizing the total number of disks used.
