PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- A company produces and sells \var{P} different products. 
- The demand for each product is unlimited, but the company is constrained by cash availability and machine capacity.
- Each unit of the \var{i}-th product requires \var{hour_i} machine hours.
- There are \var{availableHours} machine hours available in the current production period.
- The production costs are \var{cost_i} per unit of the \var{i}-th product.
- The selling prices of the \var{i}-th product is \var{price_i} per unit.
- The available cash is \var{cash}.
- Furthermore, \var{investRate_i} of the sales revenues from the \var{i}-th product will be made available to finance operations during the current period.
- \var{investPercentage_i} is a number between 0 and 1
- The company could increase its available machine hours by \var{upgradeHours}, after spending \var{upgradeCost} for certain repairs. 
- The net income from each product is the revenue we get from selling it minus the production cost and the investment cost.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "cash": cash,
    "hour": [hour_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "cost": [cost_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "price": [price_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "investPercentage": [investPercentage_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "upgradeHours": upgradeHours,   
    "upgradeCost": upgradeCost,
    "availableHours": availableHours,
}

OBJECTIVE: We are aiming at maximizing total net income subject to the cash availability and machine capacity limitations

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{net_income} shows the net income of the company
- \var{production_i} shows the production quantity of the \var{i}-th product
- \var{upgrade} is a boolean variable that shows whether the company should upgrade its machine capacity or not

    "net_income": net_income,
    "production": [production_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "upgrade": true/false,
