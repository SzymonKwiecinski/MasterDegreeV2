PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Consider the problem of operating a warehouse, by buying and selling the stock of a certain commodity, in order to maximize profit over a certain length of time, say several periods.
- The warehouse has a fixed capacity \var{capacity}, and there is a cost \var{holding_cost} per unit for holding stock for one period.
- The selling price, \var{price_{n}}$, of the commodity is known to fluctuate over a number of time periods. 
- In any period \var{n} the price holding for purchase is \var{cost_{n}}.
- The warehouse is originally empty and is required to be empty at the end of the last period.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"holding_cost": holding_cost,
	"price", [price_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"cost": [cost_{n} for n in 1,...,N]
}


OBJECTIVE: Determine the amount of buying and selling in each period to maximize the profit over the months

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{buyquantity} represents the amount of buying in each period
- \var{sellquantity} represents the amount of selling in each period
- \var{stock} represents the stock in each period, excluding the intial stock

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"buyquantity": [buyquantity_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"sellquantity": [sellquantity_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"stock": [stock_{n} for n in 1,...,N]

#### Input data

#### Parameters
N = len(data['price'])
capacity = data['capacity']
holding_cost = data['holding_cost']
prices = data['price']
costs = data['cost']

#### Create the LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Warehouse_Optimization", pulp.LpMaximize)

#### Decision variables
buy_quantities = [pulp.LpVariable(f'buy_{n}', lowBound=0) for n in range(N)]
sell_quantities = [pulp.LpVariable(f'sell_{n}', lowBound=0) for n in range(N)]
stocks = [pulp.LpVariable(f'stock_{n}', lowBound=0) for n in range(N)]

#### Objective function: Maximize profit
profit = pulp.lpSum([(prices[n] - costs[n]) * sell_quantities[n] - holding_cost * stocks[n] for n in range(N)])
problem += profit

#### Constraints
#### Capacity constraint for each period
for n in range(N):
    if n == 0:
        problem += buy_quantities[n] - sell_quantities[n] <= capacity
    else:

    #### Stock balance
    problem += stocks[n] == (stocks[n-1] + buy_quantities[n] - sell_quantities[n]) if n > 0 else buy_quantities[n] - sell_quantities[n]

#### Ending condition: stock must be empty at the end
problem += stocks[-1] == 0

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Collect results
buy_quantities_result = [pulp.value(buy_quantities[n]) for n in range(N)]
sell_quantities_result = [pulp.value(sell_quantities[n]) for n in range(N)]
