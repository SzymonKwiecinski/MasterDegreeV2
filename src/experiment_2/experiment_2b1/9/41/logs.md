Background: You are a expert at Operations Research and Linear Programming and Python. Based on description you solve given problem using Pulp python library. Python code place between ```python and ```. You receive the data in json format between: <DATA></DATA>. Do not change data format! Do not use `while` loop in python code! Do not include 'pip install' in script. Assume every python package is installed Print at the end the objective between <OBJ></OBJ> `print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')`

### ROLE: Role.USER
<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

```python
import pulp
import json

#### Input data
data = {'capacity': 3, 'size': [1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]}
capacity = data['capacity']
sizes = data['size']
N = len(sizes)

#### Create the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("FloppyDiskPacking", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Create binary decision variables for files and disks
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("file", (range(N), range(N)), cat='Binary')  #### x[i][j] is 1 if file i is on disk j
y = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("disk", range(N), cat='Binary')  #### y[j] is 1 if disk j is used

#### Objective function: Minimize the number of disks used
problem += pulp.lpSum(y[j] for j in range(N)), "MinimizeNumberOfDisks"

#### Constraints: Each file must be assigned to exactly one disk
for i in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[i][j] for j in range(N)) == 1, f"File_{i}_assigned"

#### Constraints: The total size of files on each disk cannot exceed the capacity
for j in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(sizes[i] * x[i][j] for i in range(N)) <= capacity * y[j], f"Disk_{j}_capacity"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Gather results
n_disks = int(pulp.value(problem.objective))
whichdisk = [0] * N

for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
        if pulp.value(x[i][j]) == 1:
            whichdisk[i] = j + 1  #### To make disk indices start from 1

#### Prepare the output
output = {
    "n_disks": n_disks,
    "whichdisk": whichdisk
}

print(json.dumps(output))
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
