<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "x_0": x_0,
    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,
    "T": T
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is max_t |a_t|. 

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "fuel_spend" contains the total fuel spent by the rocket

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "v": [v_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "a": [a_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "fuel_spend": fuel_spent,

```python

#### Input data
data = {'X0': 0, 'V0': 0, 'XT': 1, 'VT': 0, 'T': 20}
x_0 = data['X0']
v_0 = data['V0']
x_T = data['XT']
v_T = data['VT']
T = data['T']

#### Create a LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Rocket_Thrust_Minimization", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Create decision variables
x = [pulp.LpVariable(f'x_{t}', lowBound=None) for t in range(T + 1)]
v = [pulp.LpVariable(f'v_{t}', lowBound=None) for t in range(T + 1)]
a = [pulp.LpVariable(f'a_{t}', lowBound=None) for t in range(T)]

#### Define the initial conditions
problem += (x[0] == x_0, "Initial_Position")
problem += (v[0] == v_0, "Initial_Velocity")

#### Define the equations based on the model
for t in range(T):
    problem += (x[t + 1] == x[t] + v[t], f"Position_Update_{t}")
    problem += (v[t + 1] == v[t] + a[t], f"Velocity_Update_{t}")

#### Define final conditions
problem += (x[T] == x_T, "Final_Position")
problem += (v[T] == v_T, "Final_Velocity")

#### Objective: minimize the maximum thrust required
max_thrust = pulp.LpVariable("max_thrust", lowBound=0)
for t in range(T):
    problem += (a[t] <= max_thrust, f"Thrust_Uppper_Bound_{t}")
    problem += (a[t] >= -max_thrust, f"Thrust_Lower_Bound_{t}")

problem += max_thrust, "Minimize_Max_Thrust"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Prepare the output
x_values = [pulp.value(x[t]) for t in range(T + 1)]
v_values = [pulp.value(v[t]) for t in range(T + 1)]
a_values = [pulp.value(a[t]) for t in range(T)]
fuel_spent = pulp.value(max_thrust)

#### Output the results
output = {

    "v": v_values,
    "a": a_values,
    "fuel_spend": fuel_spent,
