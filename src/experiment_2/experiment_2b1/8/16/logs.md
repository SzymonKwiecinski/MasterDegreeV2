PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- A manager of an oil refinery has \var{allocated_i} million barrels of crude oil type \var{i} allocated for production during the coming month. 
- These resources can be used to make \var{P} different products. product \var{p} sells for $ \var{price_p} per barrel.
- There are \var{L} production processes. Process \var{l} uses \var{input_l_i} barrels of each crude \var{i}, and produces \var{output_l_p} barrels of each product \var{p}. 
- Process \var{l} has a cost of \var{cost_l} per barrel of product produced.
- All \var{input_l_i} quantities and \var{output_l_p} quanitites are in barrels. 
- There are no separate cost items for the cost of the crudes, as they have already been allocated.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "allocated": [allocated_i for i in 1, ..., O],
    "price": [price_p for p in 1, ..., P],
    "input": [[input_l_i for i in 1, ..., O] for l in 1, ..., L],
    "output": [[output_l_p for p in 1, ..., P] for l in 1, ..., L],
    "cost": [cost_l for l in 1, ..., L]
}

OBJECTIVE: We want to know how many times should we execute each process to maximize the revenue for the next month (you can assume that the number of times that each process is executed is a floating point number)

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{revenue} is the total revenue for the month.
- \var{execute_l} is the number of times that process \var{l} should be executed.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "revenue": revenue,
    "execute": [execute_l for l in 1, ..., L]
}
