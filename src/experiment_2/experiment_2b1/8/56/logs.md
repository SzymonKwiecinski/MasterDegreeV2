Background: You are a expert at Operations Research and Linear Programming and Python. Based on description you solve given problem using Pulp python library. Python code place between ```python and ```. You receive the data in json format between: <DATA></DATA>. Do not change data format! Do not use `while` loop in python code! Do not include 'pip install' in script. Assume every python package is installed Print at the end the objective between <OBJ></OBJ> `print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')`

PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

<DATA>

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
```python
import json
import pulp

#### Input data
data = {'west_time': [[3.5, 4.5], [4, 4], [5, 4]], 'north_time': [[10, 10, 9], [9, 9, 12]]}

#### Extracting dimensions
N = len(data['north_time']) + 1  #### Number of streets
W = len(data['west_time'][0]) + 1  #### Number of avenues

#### Create the Linear Program
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Delivery_Optimization", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables for the grid
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("path", (range(N), range(W)), 0, 1, pulp.LpBinary)

#### Objective function: Minimize total travel time
total_time = pulp.lpSum(data['west_time'][n][w] * x[n][w] for n in range(N) for w in range(W-1)) + \
             pulp.lpSum(data['north_time'][n][w] * x[n][w] for n in range(N-1) for w in range(W))
problem += total_time

#### Constraints
#### Start point
problem += x[0][0] == 1

#### End point should be reached
problem += pulp.lpSum(x[N-1][w] for w in range(W)) == 1
problem += pulp.lpSum(x[n][W-1] for n in range(N)) == 1

#### Flow conservation: Moving right (west)
for n in range(N):
    for w in range(W-1):
        problem += x[n][w] <= pulp.lpSum(x[n][w+1] for n in range(N))

#### Flow conservation: Moving up (north)
for n in range(N-1):
    for w in range(W):
        problem += x[n][w] <= pulp.lpSum(x[n+1][w] for w in range(W))

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extracting the paths
paths = [(n, w) for n in range(N) for w in range(W) if pulp.value(x[n][w]) == 1]

#### Extract the total travel time
total_travel_time = pulp.value(problem.objective)

#### Preparing output
output = {
    "paths": paths,
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

#### Print the objective value
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
