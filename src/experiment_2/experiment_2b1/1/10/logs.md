Python code place between ```python and ```. You receive the data in json format between: <DATA></DATA>. Do not change data format! Do not use `while` loop in python code! Do not include 'pip install' in script. Assume every python package is installed Print at the end the objective between <OBJ></OBJ> `print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')`

PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a school district with \var{N} neighborhoods, \var{S} schools, and \var{G} grades at each school.
- Each school \var{s} has a capacity of \var{capacity_{s,g}} for grade \var{g}. 
- In each neighborhood \var{n}, the student population of grade \var{g} is \var{population_{n,g}}. 
- Finally, the distance of school \var{s} from neighborhood \var{n} is \var{d_{i,j}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "capacity": [[capacity_{s,g} for g in 1, ..., G] for s in 1, ..., S],
    "population": [[population_{n,g} for g in 1, ..., G] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "distance": [[d_{n,s} for s in 1, ..., S] for n in 1, ..., N]
}

OBJECTIVE: We want to assign all students to schools, while minimizing the total distance traveled by all students. We may ignore the fact that numbers of students must be integers.

OUTPUT INFO:
- the output should show optimal \var{x_{n,s,g}} for all \var{n}, \var{s}, \var{g} (i.e., the number of students of grade \var{g} in neighborhood \var{n} assigned to school \var{s}).
- the output should also include \var{total_distance}, the total distance traveled by all students.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "assignment": [[[x_{n,s,g} for g in 1, ..., G] for s in 1, ..., S] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "total_distance": total_distance
}

#### Define the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("School_Assignment", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("x", ((n, s, g) for n in range(N) for s in range(S) for g in range(G)), lowBound=0)

#### Objective function: minimize total distance
problem += pulp.lpSum(x[n, s, g] * distance[n][s] for n in range(N) for s in range(S) for g in range(G))

#### Constraints: capacity constraints for each school and grade
for s in range(S):
    for g in range(G):
        problem += pulp.lpSum(x[n, s, g] for n in range(N)) <= capacity[s][g]

#### Constraints: population constraints for each neighborhood and grade
for n in range(N):
    for g in range(G):
        problem += pulp.lpSum(x[n, s, g] for s in range(S)) == population[n][g]

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Prepare the output
assignment = [[[x[n, s, g].varValue for g in range(G)] for s in range(S)] for n in range(N)]
total_distance = pulp.value(problem.objective)

#### Output the result
result = {
    "assignment": assignment,
    "total_distance": total_distance
}

#### Print the objective value
