Background: You are a expert at Operations Research and Linear Programming and Python. Based on description you solve given problem using Pulp python library. Python code place between ```python and ```. You receive the data in json format between: <DATA></DATA>. Do not change data format! Do not use `while` loop in python code! Do not include 'pip install' in script. Assume every python package is installed Print at the end the objective between <OBJ></OBJ> `print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')`

PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- Consider a set \var{P} described by linear inequality constraints, that is:
 \var{P} = {\var{x} \in R^\var{N} | \var{a_i}^T x <= \var{b_i} , i = 1, ..., m}.

where \var{a_i} \in R^\var{N} and \var{b_i} \in R

- A ball with center \var{y} in R^\var{N} and radius \var{r} is defined as the set of all points within (Euclidean) distance \var{r} from \var{y}.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "A": [[a_i_j for j in 1, ..., n] for i in 1, ..., m],
    "b": [b_i for i in 1, ..., m]
}

OBJECTIVE: We are interested in finding a ball with the largest possible radius, which is entirely contained within the set \var{P} (The center of such a ball is called the Chebychev center of \var{P}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- center (list): The center of the ball as a list of floats of length \var{N}
- radius (float): The radius of the ball as a float

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "center": [y_j for j in 1, ..., n],
    "radius": r
}

#### Input data
data = {'M': 4, 'N': 2, 'A': [[1.0, 0.0], [-1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, -1.0]], 'B': [2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0]}

M = data['M']
N = data['N']
A = data['A']
B = data['B']

#### Create the LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Chebyshev_Center_Problem", pulp.LpMaximize)

#### Variables for the center of the ball
y = [pulp.LpVariable(f'y_{j}', cat='Continuous') for j in range(N)]

#### Variable for the radius of the ball
r = pulp.LpVariable("r", lowBound=0)

#### Objective function: maximize the radius r
problem += r

#### Constraints to ensure that the ball is within the feasible region
for i in range(M):
    problem += (pulp.lpSum(A[i][j] * y[j] for j in range(N)) <= B[i] - r)

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Extract the center and radius
center = [pulp.value(y[j]) for j in range(N)]
radius = pulp.value(r)

#### Output the result
result = {
    "center": center,
    "radius": radius
}

#### Print the objective value as requested
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
