<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"benefit": [[benefit_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...,K],
	"communication": [[communication_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
	"cost": [[cost_{l, m} for m in 1,...,L] for l in 1,...,L],
}


OBJECTIVE: Where should each department be located so as to minimize overall yearly cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{islocated_{k, l}} represents whether department \var{k} is relocated at city \var{l}
