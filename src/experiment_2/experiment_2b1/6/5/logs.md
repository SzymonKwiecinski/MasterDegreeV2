PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- Consider a communication network consisting of \var{n} nodes.
- Nodes are con­nected by communication links.
- A link allowing one-way transmission from node \var{i} to node \var{j} is described by an ordered pair (\var{i},\var{j}). 
- Let \var{A} be the set of all links. 
- We assume that each link (\var{i},\var{j}) \in \var{A} can carry up to \var{U_{i,j}} bits per second. 
- There is a positive cost \var{C_{i,j}} per bit transmitted along that link. 
- Each node \var{k} generates data, at the rate of \var{B_{k,l}} bits per second, that have to be transmitted to node \var{l}, either through a direct link (\var{k}, \var{l}) or by tracing a sequence of links. 
- We allow the data with the same origin and destination to be split and be transmitted along different paths.

INPUT FORMAT:

        }
    ]
}


OBJECTIVE: Find paths along which all data reach their intended destinations, while minimizing the total cost. 



OUTPUT INFO:
- \var{total_cost} represents the total cost of all the paths
- \var{path_cost} represents the cost of the corresponding path
- \var{path_flow} represents the flow going through the corresponding path
