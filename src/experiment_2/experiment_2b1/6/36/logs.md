PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A manufacturer wishes to produce \var{alloy_quant} lb of an alloy that consists of several kinds of metals.
- And by weight, the alloy we want contains a target quantity\var{target_{m}} of metal \var{metal_{m}}.
- Several other kinds of alloys are available at various prices. 
- These alloys can be melted to get the alloy we want.
- Alloy \var{k} has \var{ratio_{k, m}} ratio of \var{metal_{m}} and is sold at price of \var{price_k}.
- Ratio \var{ratio_{k, m}} ranges between 0 and 1.0 and should be properly treated in optimization

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"alloy_quant": alloy_quant,
	"target": [target_{m} for m in 1,...,M],
	"ratio": [[ratio_{k, m} for m in 1,...,M] for k = 1,...,K],
	"price": [price_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}

OBJECTIVE: The manufacturer wishes to find the amounts of the various alloys needed and to determine the cheapest combination.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{amount} represents the quantity of each alloy we buy

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"amount": [amount_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}
