PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- The town has \var{S} different shifts for the police officers during the day.
- During each shift \var{s}, the town requires \var{officers_needed_{s}} police officers on duty.
- Each police officer works for two consecutive shifts.
- The cost for the town when starting a shift at \var{s} is \var{shift_cost_{s}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "officers_needed": [officers_needed_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "shift_costs": [shift_cost_{s} for s in 1, ..., S]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many officers should the town assign to each shift in order to minimize the total cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- The number of officers assigned to each shift \var{officers_assigned_{s}}.
- \var{total_cost} indicates the total cost for the town.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "officers_assigned": [officers_assigned_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "total_cost": total_cost
