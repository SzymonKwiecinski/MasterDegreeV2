PROBLEM INFO:

- The town has \var{S} different shifts for the police officers during the day.
- During each shift \var{s}, the town requires \var{officers_needed_{s}} police officers on duty.
- Each police officer works for two consecutive shifts.
- The cost for the town when starting a shift at \var{s} is \var{shift_cost_{s}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "officers_needed": [officers_needed_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "shift_costs": [shift_cost_{s} for s in 1, ..., S]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many officers should the town assign to each shift in order to minimize the total cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- The number of officers assigned to each shift \var{officers_assigned_{s}}.
- \var{total_cost} indicates the total cost for the town.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

``` 

In the original code, the error was caused by trying to use the floor division operator `//` on an `LpVariable`, which is not allowed. To fix this, we can directly use the `officers_assigned[s]` in the objective function, and since each officer works for two consecutive shifts, we can construct the problem without needing to divide by 2 in the cost calculation. 

Hereâ€™s a revised version:

```python
import pulp
import json

#### Input data
data = {'NumShifts': 6, 'OfficersNeeded': [15, 13, 11, 11, 9, 7], 'ShiftCosts': [500, 480, 450, 460, 470, 490]}
officers_needed = data['OfficersNeeded']
shift_costs = data['ShiftCosts']
num_shifts = data['NumShifts']

#### Create the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Police_Officer_Assignment", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
officers_assigned = [pulp.LpVariable(f'Officers_Assigned_{s}', lowBound=0, cat='Integer') for s in range(num_shifts)]

#### Objective function
#### Shift cost is incurred for every officer assigned for each shift
problem += pulp.lpSum(shift_costs[s] * officers_assigned[s] for s in range(num_shifts)), "Total Cost"

#### Constraints to ensure enough officers are present
for s in range(num_shifts):
    if s == 0:
        problem += officers_assigned[s] + officers_assigned[s + 1] >= officers_needed[s], f"Officers_needed_{s}"
    elif s == num_shifts - 1:
        problem += officers_assigned[s - 1] + officers_assigned[s] >= officers_needed[s], f"Officers_needed_{s}"
    else:
        problem += officers_assigned[s - 1] + officers_assigned[s] + officers_assigned[s + 1] >= officers_needed[s], f"Officers_needed_{s}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Prepare output
assigned_officers = [int(officers_assigned[s].varValue) for s in range(num_shifts)]
total_cost = pulp.value(problem.objective)

#### Output the solution
output = {
    "officers_assigned": assigned_officers,
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

print(json.dumps(output, indent=4))
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{total_cost}</OBJ>')
``` 

This version should work correctly without the previous error.
