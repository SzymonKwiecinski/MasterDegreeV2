PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a road divided into \var{N} segments that is illuminated by \var{M} lamps.
- Let \var{power_j} be the power of the \var{j}-th lamp. The illumination \var{ill_i} of the \var{i}-th segment is assumed to be \sum_{j=1}^{\var{M}} \var{coeff_{i,j}} \var{power_j}, where \var{coeff_{i,j}} are known coefficients.
- Let \var{desired_i} be the desired illumination of road \var{i}. 
- We are interested in choosing the lamp powers \var{power_j} so that the illuminations {ill_i} are close to the desired illuminations {desired_i}. 

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "coeff": [[coeff_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., M] for i in 1, ..., N],
    "desired": [desired_i for i in 1, ..., N]
}

OBJECTIVE: Find the lamp powers \var{power_j} that minimize the absolute error between the illuminations {ill_i} and the desired illuminations {desired_i}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{power_j} is the optimal power of the \var{j}-th lamp.
- \var{error} is the absolute error between the illuminations {ill_i} and the desired illuminations {desired_i}.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "power": [power_j for j in 1, ..., M]
    "error": error
}

#### Input data
data = {'N': 3, 'M': 2, 'Coefficients': [[0.5, 0.3], [0.2, 0.4], [0.1, 0.6]], 'DesiredIlluminations': [14, 3, 12]}

N = data['N']
M = data['M']
coefficients = data['Coefficients']
desired_illuminations = data['DesiredIlluminations']

#### Create the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Illumination_Error", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Create decision variables for lamp powers
powers = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("Power", range(M), lowBound=0)

#### Create variables to capture error
error = pulp.LpVariable("Error", lowBound=0)

#### Objective function: minimize the sum of errors
problem += error

#### Constraints to formulate the absolute error
for i in range(N):
    #### Calculate illumination for segment i
    illumination = pulp.lpSum(coefficients[i][j] * powers[j] for j in range(M))
    
    #### Constraints for the absolute error
    problem += illumination - desired_illuminations[i] <= error
    problem += desired_illuminations[i] - illumination <= error

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Preparing the output
output = {
    "power": [pulp.value(powers[j]) for j in range(M)],
    "error": pulp.value(error)
}

#### Print the objective value
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')

#### JSON output
print(json.dumps(output))
