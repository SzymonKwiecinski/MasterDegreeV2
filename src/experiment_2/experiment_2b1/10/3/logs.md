<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- A state wants to plan its electricity capacity for the next \var{T} years. 
- The state has a forecast of \var{demand_t} megawatts, presumed accurate, of the demand for electricity during year \var{t}.
- The existing capacity, which is in oil-fired plants, that will not be retired and will be available during year \var{t}, is \var{oil_t}.
- There are two alternatives for expanding electric capacity: coalÂ­ fired or nuclear power plants.
- There is a capital cost of \var{coal_cost} per megawatt of coal-fired capacity that becomes operational at the beginning of year \var{t}.
- There is a capital cost of \var{nuke_cost} per megawatt of nuclear power capacity that becomes operational at the beginning of year \var{t}.
- For various political and safety reasons, it has been decided that no more than \var{max_nuke}% of the total capacity should ever be nuclear (\var{max_nuke} is a number between 0 and 100).
- Coal plants last for \var{coal_life} years, while nuclear plants last for \var{nuke_life} years.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "demand": [demand_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "oil_cap": [oil_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "coal_cost": coal_cost,
    "nuke_cost": nuke_cost,
    "max_nuke": max_nuke,
    "coal_life": coal_life,
    "nuke_life": nuke_life,
}


OBJECTIVE: What is the capacity expansion plan that results in the minimum cost?


OUTPUT INFO:

- the output should represent how much coal and nuclear capacity should be added in each year, and how much the total cost is.
- the output should be a dictionary with three keys: "coal_cap_added", "nuke_cap_added", and "total_cost".
- the value of "coal_cap_added" should be a list of the coal capacity added in each year.
- the value of "nuke_cap_added" should be a list of the nuclear capacity added in each year.
- the value of "total_cost" should be a single floating point number showing the total cost of the system.


OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "coal_cap_added": [coal_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "nuke_cap_added": [nuke_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "total_cost": total_cost,
}

#### Input data
data = {'T': 12, 'Demand': [10, 15, 17, 20, 13, 19, 10, 25, 30, 33, 30, 35],

        'MaxNuke': 20,

        'NukeLife': 10}

#### Define the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Electricity_Capacity_Planning", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
coal_capacity_added = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("Coal", range(data['T']), lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')
nuke_capacity_added = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("Nuke", range(data['T']), lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')

#### Objective function
problem += pulp.lpSum(data['CoalCost'] * coal_capacity_added[t] + data['NukeCost'] * nuke_capacity_added[t] for t in range(data['T']))

#### Constraints
for t in range(data['T']):
    total_capacity = data['OilCap'][t]
    for k in range(data['CoalLife']):
        if t - k >= 0:
            total_capacity += coal_capacity_added[t - k]
    for k in range(data['NukeLife']):
        if t - k >= 0:
            total_capacity += nuke_capacity_added[t - k]
    
    #### Capacity must meet demand
    problem += total_capacity >= data['Demand'][t], f"Demand_Constraint_{t}"

#### Nuclear capacity constraint
for t in range(data['T']):
    total_nuke_capacity = pulp.lpSum(nuke_capacity_added[i] for i in range(t + 1) if i < data['NukeLife'])  #### Sum of nuclear capacity added
    total_capacity = data['OilCap'][t]
    for k in range(data['CoalLife']):
        if t - k >= 0:
            total_capacity += coal_capacity_added[t - k]
    
    problem += total_nuke_capacity <= (total_capacity * data['MaxNuke'] / 100), f"Nuclear_Capacity_Constraint_{t}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Prepare the output
coal_cap_added = [coal_capacity_added[t].value() for t in range(data['T'])]
nuke_cap_added = [nuke_capacity_added[t].value() for t in range(data['T'])]
total_cost = pulp.value(problem.objective)

#### Output result
