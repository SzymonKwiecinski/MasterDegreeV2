<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}
