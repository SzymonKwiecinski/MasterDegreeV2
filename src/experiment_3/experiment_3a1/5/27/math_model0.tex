\section*{Problem Definition}

A company needs to decide the optimal location for its departments to minimize yearly costs associated with relocation and communication.

\section*{Parameters}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( K \) denote the number of departments.
    \item \( L \) denote the number of possible cities including London.
    \item \( \text{benefit}_{k, l} \) be the benefit (in thousands of pounds) for department \( k \) from relocation at city \( l \).
    \item \( \text{communication}_{k, j} \) be the quantity of communication between department \( k \) and department \( j \).
    \item \( \text{cost}_{l, m} \) be the unit cost of communication between city \( l \) and city \( m \).
    \item \( \text{islocated}_{k, l} \) be a binary variable that determines if department \( k \) is located at city \( l \).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Objective Function}

We want to minimize the overall cost given by:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{islocated}_{k, l} \left( \sum_{j=1}^{K} \text{communication}_{k, j} \cdot \sum_{m=1}^{L} \text{cost}_{l, m} \cdot \text{islocated}_{j, m} \right) - \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{islocated}_{k, l} \cdot \text{benefit}_{k, l}
\]

\section*{Constraints}

1. Each department can be located in only one city:

\[
\sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{islocated}_{k, l} = 1, \quad \forall k = 1, 2, \ldots, K
\]

2. No more than three departments can be located in the same city:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{islocated}_{k, l} \leq 3, \quad \forall l = 1, 2, \ldots, L
\]

3. The binary nature of the location decision:

\[
\text{islocated}_{k, l} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall k = 1, 2, \ldots, K, \; l = 1, 2, \ldots, L
\]

\section*{Output}

The model will return a binary matrix \( \text{islocated} \) such that:

\[
\text{islocated} = \left[ \text{islocated}_{k, l} \right] \text{ for } k = 1, \ldots, K \text{ and } l = 1, \ldots, L
\]
