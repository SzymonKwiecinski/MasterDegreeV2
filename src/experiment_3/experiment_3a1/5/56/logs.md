PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Delivery Person's Optimal Path}

\subsection*{Problem Definition}
The delivery person starts at the intersection of the 1st Avenue and 1st Street and needs to reach the intersection of the Wth Avenue and Nth Street. The path can be represented as an \( (N-1) \times (W-1) \) grid, where the time taken to move between intersections varies.

\subsection*{Variables}
Let:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_{n,w} \) = 1 if the delivery person moves from the intersection at \( w \)th Avenue and \( n \)th Street to the intersection at \( (w+1) \)th Avenue and \( n \)th Street; 0 otherwise.
    \item \( y_{n,w} \) = 1 if the delivery person moves from the intersection at \( w \)th Avenue and \( n \)th Street to the intersection at \( w \)th Avenue and \( (n+1) \)th Street; 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{west\_time}_{n,w} \) = time taken to move west from intersection \( (w,n) \) to \( (w+1,n) \)
    \item \( \text{north\_time}_{n,w} \) = time taken to move north from intersection \( (w,n) \) to \( (w,n+1) \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total travel time:
\[
\text{minimize } Z = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} \text{west\_time}_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w} + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W} \text{north\_time}_{n,w} \cdot y_{n,w}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. Flow conservation for moving west:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n,w} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} y_{n,w} + 1 \quad \forall w = 1, \ldots, W-1
\]
2. Flow conservation for moving north:
\[
\sum_{w=1}^{W} y_{n,w} = \sum_{w=1}^{W} x_{n,w} + 1 \quad \forall n = 1, \ldots, N-1
\]
3. Non-negativity and binary conditions:
\[
x_{n,w}, y_{n,w} \in \{0, 1\}
\]

\subsection*{Output}
The output will provide:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{paths} \): List of tuples representing the intersections visited.
    \item \( \text{total\_time} \): The minimum total time taken for the delivery.
\end{itemize}
