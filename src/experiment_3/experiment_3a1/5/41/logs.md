PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

\section*{Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Model for Floppy Disk Backup}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $C$: Capacity of each floppy disk (in GB).
    \item $N$: Total number of files.
    \item $size_j$: Size of file $j$ (in GB) for $j = 1, \ldots, N$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n\_disks$: Total number of floppy disks used.
    \item $x_{ij}$: Binary variable which is 1 if file $j$ is stored on disk $i$, and 0 otherwise.
    \item $y_i$: Binary variable which is 1 if disk $i$ is used, and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the number of floppy disks used:
\[
\text{Minimize } n\_disks = \sum_{i=1}^{M} y_i
\]

where $M$ is an upper bound on the number of disks.

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. Each file must be assigned to exactly one disk:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{M} x_{ij} = 1, \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, N
\]

2. The total size of the files on each disk cannot exceed its capacity:
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{N} size_j \cdot x_{ij} \leq C \cdot y_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M
\]

3. The relationship between $n\_disks$ and $y_i$:
\[
y_i \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M
\]
\[
n\_disks \geq y_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M
\]

\subsection*{Output}
The outputs will be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n\_disks$: Total number of floppy disks used.
    \item $whichdisk$: An array where $whichdisk_j$ indicates the disk on which file $j$ is stored, for $j = 1, \ldots, N$.
\end{itemize}
