\section*{Linear Programming Model for Power Plant Electricity Distribution}

\textbf{Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P$: Number of power plants
    \item $C$: Number of cities
    \item $supply_{p}$: Capacity of power plant $p$ (in million kwh)
    \item $demand_{c}$: Peak demand of city $c$ (in million kwh)
    \item $transmission_{p,c}$: Transmission cost from power plant $p$ to city $c$ (in \$/million kwh)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $send_{p,c}$: Amount of electricity sent from power plant $p$ to city $c$ (in million kwh)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective Function:}
Minimize the total transmission cost:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{p=1}^{P} \sum_{c=1}^{C} transmission_{p,c} \cdot send_{p,c}
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Supply Constraints:} The total electricity sent from each power plant cannot exceed its supply capacity:
    \[
    \sum_{c=1}^{C} send_{p,c} \leq supply_{p}, \quad \forall p = 1, \ldots, P
    \]
    
    \item \textbf{Demand Constraints:} The total electricity received by each city must meet its peak demand:
    \[
    \sum_{p=1}^{P} send_{p,c} \geq demand_{c}, \quad \forall c = 1, \ldots, C
    \]
    
    \item \textbf{Non-negativity Constraints:} The amount of electricity sent must be non-negative:
    \[
    send_{p,c} \geq 0, \quad \forall p = 1, \ldots, P, \quad \forall c = 1, \ldots, C
    \]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Output:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $send_{p,c}$: The amount of electricity power plant $p$ sends to city $c$ (in million kwh)
    \item $total\_cost$: The total transmission cost for the utility
\end{itemize}
