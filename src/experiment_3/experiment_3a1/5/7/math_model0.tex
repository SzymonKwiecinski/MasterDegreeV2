\section*{Mathematical Model for Rocket Dynamics}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The system is described by the following discrete-time equations:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} & = x_t + v_t \\
    v_{t+1} & = v_t + a_t
\end{align}

The objective is to control the acceleration \( a_t \) such that we reach the target position \( x_T \) with the desired velocity \( v_T \) at time \( T \), while minimizing the maximum thrust required, which can be described as minimizing \( \max_{t} |a_t| \).

\subsection*{Input Parameters}
Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial position: \( x_0 \)
    \item Initial velocity: \( v_0 \)
    \item Target position: \( x_T \)
    \item Target velocity: \( v_T \)
    \item Total time: \( T \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( a_t \): acceleration at time \( t \), where \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize:
\[
z = \max_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
The following constraints must be satisfied:
\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} - x_t - v_t & = 0, \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
    v_{t+1} - v_t - a_t & = 0, \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
    x_T & = x_T \\
    v_T & = v_T 
\end{align}

\subsection*{Output}
The solution should provide:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Key "x" containing the list of positions at each time step from \( 0 \) to \( T \)
    \item Key "v" containing the list of velocities at each time step from \( 0 \) to \( T \)
    \item Key "a" containing the list of accelerations at each time step from \( 0 \) to \( T \)
    \item Key "fuel\_spend" containing the total fuel spent by the rocket
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Output Format}
\[
\text{{Output}} = 
\begin{cases}
    "x": [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T] \\
    "v": [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T] \\
    "a": [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T] \\
    "fuel\_spend": \text{total fuel spent}
\end{cases}
\]
