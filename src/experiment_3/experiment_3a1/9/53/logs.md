PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
        for id in 1, ..., m
    ],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

    \item \( demand_l \): Demand for soybeans at destination city \( l \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( amount_{i,j} \): Amount of soybeans shipped from city \( i \) to city \( j \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \cdot amount_{i,j}

\[
amount_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \forall (i,j) \in A
\]

\subsection*{Output}
The final output will consist of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A distribution of soybeans shipped from each source to each destination represented as:
    \[
    \text{distribution} = \{ \{from: i, to: j, amount: amount_{i,j}\} \mid (i,j) \in A \}
    \]
    \item Total transportation cost:
