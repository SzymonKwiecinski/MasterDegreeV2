\section*{Rocket Motion Linear Programming Model}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The discrete-time model is defined as follows:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]

\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

We assume that the acceleration \( a_t \) is controlled by the rocket thrust, and its magnitude \( |a_t| \) is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \( t \). Given the initial conditions:

\[
x_0, \quad v_0
\]

we aim to reach a target position \( x_T \) with a target velocity \( v_T \) at time \( T \). Our objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required:

\[
\text{Objective:} \quad \min \max_{t} |a_t|
\]

The constraints for the problem can be formulated as follows:

1. State update equations for position and velocity:
   \[
   x_{t+1} - x_t - v_t = 0 \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \dots, T-1
   \]
   \[
   v_{t+1} - v_t - a_t = 0 \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \dots, T-1
   \]

2. Initial conditions:
   \[
   x_0 = x_0, \quad v_0 = v_0
   \]

3. Target conditions:
   \[
   x_T = x_T, \quad v_T = v_T
   \]

4. Thrust limitation:
   \[
   -M \leq a_t \leq M \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \dots, T-1
   \]
   where \( M \) is the maximum allowable thrust.

The output format consists of lists for positions, velocities, accelerations, and total fuel spent:

\[
\text{Output:}
\]

\[
\{ 
\text{"x"}: [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T], 
\text{"v"}: [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T], 
\text{"a"}: [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T], 
\text{"fuel\_spend"}: \text{fuel\_spent}
\}
\]
