PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

\section*{Rocket Motion Linear Programming Model}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The discrete-time model is defined as follows:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]

\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

We assume that the acceleration \( a_t \) is controlled by the rocket thrust, and its magnitude \( |a_t| \) is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \( t \). Given the initial conditions:

\[
x_0, \quad v_0
\]

we aim to reach a target position \( x_T \) with a target velocity \( v_T \) at time \( T \). Our objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required:

\[
\text{Objective:} \quad \min \max_{t} |a_t|
\]

The constraints for the problem can be formulated as follows:

1. State update equations for position and velocity:
   \[
   x_{t+1} - x_t - v_t = 0 \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \dots, T-1
   \]
   \[
   v_{t+1} - v_t - a_t = 0 \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \dots, T-1
   \]

2. Initial conditions:
   \[
   x_0 = x_0, \quad v_0 = v_0
   \]

3. Target conditions:
   \[
   x_T = x_T, \quad v_T = v_T
   \]

4. Thrust limitation:
   \[
   -M \leq a_t \leq M \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \dots, T-1
   \]
   where \( M \) is the maximum allowable thrust.

The output format consists of lists for positions, velocities, accelerations, and total fuel spent:

\[
\text{Output:}
\]

\[
\{ 
\text{"x"}: [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T],
