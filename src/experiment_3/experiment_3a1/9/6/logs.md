PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT:

    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,

}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the total fuel \sum_{t=0}^{\var{T}-1} |\var{a_t}| spent subject to the preceding constraints.

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}

\section*{Mathematical Model for Rocket Trajectory Optimization}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) denote the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The discrete-time model is defined as follows:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]

\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

Assuming that the acceleration \( a_t \) is under our control and is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption, we aim to minimize the total fuel used over a time horizon from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = T-1 \). 

Given the inputs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial position: \( x_0 \)
    \item Initial velocity: \( v_0 \)
    \item Target position: \( x_T \)
    \item Target velocity: \( v_T \)
    \item Total time steps: \( T \)
\end{itemize}

The optimization problem can be formulated as follows:

\textbf{Objective:}
Minimize the total fuel consumption:
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}
\begin{align*}
x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t, \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
x_0 &= \text{initial position} \\
v_0 &= \text{initial velocity} \\
x_T &= \text{target position} \\
v_T &= \text{target velocity} \\
\end{align*}

\textbf{Output:}
The solution includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x \): positions of the rocket at each time step from \( 0 \) to \( T \)
    \item \( v \): velocities of the rocket at each time step from \( 0 \) to \( T \)
    \item \( a \): accelerations of the rocket at each time step from \( 0 \) to \( T \)
    \item \( \text{fuel\_spend} \): total fuel spent by the rocket
\end{itemize}

The output format will be:
\[
\{ 
    "x": [x_i \, | \, i = 1, \ldots, T], 
    "v": [v_i \, | \, i = 1, \ldots, T], 
    "a": [a_i \, | \, i = 1, \ldots, T], 
    "fuel\_spend": \text{fuel\_spent}
