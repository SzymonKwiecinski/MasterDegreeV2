\section*{Mathematical Model for Rocket Trajectory Optimization}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) denote the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The discrete-time model is defined as follows:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]

\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

Assuming that the acceleration \( a_t \) is under our control and is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption, we aim to minimize the total fuel used over a time horizon from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = T-1 \). 

Given the inputs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial position: \( x_0 \)
    \item Initial velocity: \( v_0 \)
    \item Target position: \( x_T \)
    \item Target velocity: \( v_T \)
    \item Total time steps: \( T \)
\end{itemize}

The optimization problem can be formulated as follows:

\textbf{Objective:}
Minimize the total fuel consumption:
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}
\begin{align*}
x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t, \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
x_0 &= \text{initial position} \\
v_0 &= \text{initial velocity} \\
x_T &= \text{target position} \\
v_T &= \text{target velocity} \\
\end{align*}

\textbf{Output:}
The solution includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x \): positions of the rocket at each time step from \( 0 \) to \( T \)
    \item \( v \): velocities of the rocket at each time step from \( 0 \) to \( T \)
    \item \( a \): accelerations of the rocket at each time step from \( 0 \) to \( T \)
    \item \( \text{fuel\_spend} \): total fuel spent by the rocket
\end{itemize}

The output format will be:
\[
\{ 
    "x": [x_i \, | \, i = 1, \ldots, T], 
    "v": [v_i \, | \, i = 1, \ldots, T], 
    "a": [a_i \, | \, i = 1, \ldots, T], 
    "fuel\_spend": \text{fuel\_spent} 
\}
\]
