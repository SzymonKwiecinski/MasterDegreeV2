\section*{Linear Programming Model for Power Distribution}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( send_{p,c} \): Amount of electricity sent from power plant \( p \) to city \( c \) (in million kWh).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( P \): Total number of power plants.
    \item \( C \): Total number of cities.
    \item \( supply_{p} \): Capacity of power plant \( p \) (in million kWh).
    \item \( demand_{c} \): Peak demand of city \( c \) (in million kWh).
    \item \( transmission_{p,c} \): Transmission cost from power plant \( p \) to city \( c \) (in $/million kWh).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective Function:}
Minimize the total transmission cost:

\[
\min Z = \sum_{p=1}^{P} \sum_{c=1}^{C} transmission_{p,c} \cdot send_{p,c}
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}

1. Supply constraints for each power plant:

\[
\sum_{c=1}^{C} send_{p,c} \leq supply_{p}, \quad \forall p = 1, \ldots, P
\]

2. Demand constraints for each city:

\[
\sum_{p=1}^{P} send_{p,c} \geq demand_{c}, \quad \forall c = 1, \ldots, C
\]

3. Non-negativity constraints:

\[
send_{p,c} \geq 0, \quad \forall p = 1, \ldots, P \quad \text{and} \quad c = 1, \ldots, C
\]

\textbf{Output:}
The amount of electricity sent from each power plant to each city and the total transmission cost, represented as:

\[
\text{Output} = \{ send: [[send_{p,c} \text{ for } c = 1, \ldots, C] \text{ for } p = 1, \ldots, P], total\_cost: Z \} 
\]
