\section*{Linear Programming Model for Stock Selling Problem}

\subsection*{Variables}
Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N$: Number of different stocks
    \item $bought_i$: Number of shares bought of stock $i$
    \item $buyPrice_i$: Price at which stock $i$ was bought
    \item $currentPrice_i$: Current price of stock $i$
    \item $futurePrice_i$: Expected price of stock $i$ in one year
    \item $transactionRate$: Transaction cost rate (in percentage)
    \item $taxRate$: Tax rate on capital gains (in percentage)
    \item $K$: Target net amount to raise
    \item $sell_i$: Number of shares to sell of stock $i$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to maximize the expected value of the portfolio next year, while ensuring that the net amount raised is at least $K$:

\[
\text{maximize} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{N} (futurePrice_i \cdot (bought_i - sell_i)) - \sum_{i=1}^{N} (sell_i \cdot currentPrice_i)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
The constraints include the need to raise a net amount of at least $K$ after transaction costs and taxes:

The amount raised from selling shares $i$ is given by:

\[
\text{Amount\_Raised}_i = sell_i \cdot currentPrice_i
\]

The capital gains from selling shares is given by:

\[
\text{Capital\_Gains}_i = (currentPrice_i - buyPrice_i) \cdot sell_i
\]

The transaction cost for selling shares is:

\[
\text{Transaction\_Cost}_i = transactionRate \cdot \text{Amount\_Raised}_i
\]

The net amount raised after considering transaction costs and taxes on capital gains can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Net\_Amount} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \text{Amount\_Raised}_i - \text{Transaction\_Cost}_i - (taxRate \cdot \text{Capital\_Gains}_i) \right)
\]

Thus, the constraint can be formulated as:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( sell_i \cdot currentPrice_i - transactionRate \cdot (sell_i \cdot currentPrice_i) - taxRate \cdot ((currentPrice_i - buyPrice_i) \cdot sell_i) \right) \geq K
\]

\subsection*{Non-negativity Constraints}
Additionally, we impose that the number of shares to sell cannot be negative:

\[
sell_i \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}
\]
