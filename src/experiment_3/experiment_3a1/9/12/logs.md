PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Suppose that there are \var{N} available currencies, and assume that one unit of currency \var{i} can be exchanged for \var{rate_{i,j}} units of currency \var{j} (Naturally, we assume that \var{rate_{i,j}} > 0).
- There are also certain regulations that impose a limit \var{limit_i} on the total amount of currency \var{i} that can be exchanged (whether to other currencies or from other currencies) on any given day.
- Suppose that we start the day with \var{start_i} units of currency \var{i}
- Provide a linear programming formulation of this problem. Assume that for any sequence \var{i_1}, â€¦ ,\var{i_k} of currencies, we have \var{rate_{i_1,i_2}}, \var{rate_{i_2,i_3}}, ..., \var{rate_{i_{k-1}, i_{k}}, \var{rate_{i_k, i_1}} <= 1, which means that wealth cannot be multiplied by going through a cycle of currencies.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "start": [start_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "limit": [limit_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "rate": [[rate_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., N] for i in 1, ..., N],
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to maximize the number of units of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day, through a sequence of currency transactions.

OUTPUT INFO: 

- The output json file contains a list of transactions, where each transaction is a json object with the following fields:
    - from: the currency that we are exchanging from
    - to: the currency that we are exchanging to
    - amount: the amount of currency that we are exchanging
- The output json file also contains the final amount of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day.

OUTPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": i,
            "to": j,
            "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
    ],
    "final_amount_of_currency_N": final_amount_of_currency_N

\section*{Linear Programming Formulation}

Given the problem setup, we define the following variables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( x_{i,j} \) be the amount of currency \( i \) exchanged for currency \( j \).
    \item Let \( y_i \) be the amount of currency \( i \) held after all transactions.
\end{itemize}

######### Objective Function:
We want to maximize the total amount of currency \( N \) at the end of the day:

\[
\text{Maximize } y_N
\]

######### Constraints:

1. **Initial Currency Holdings:**
   The amount of currency \( i \) after transactions should equal the initial amount plus the amounts received and minus the amounts exchanged:
   \[
   y_i = start_i + \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{j,i} - \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} \quad \forall i \in \{1, 2, ..., N\}
   \]

2. **Currency Exchange Limits:**
   We need to respect the regulations that limit the total amount of currency \( i \) that can be exchanged:
   \[
   \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} + \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{j,i} \leq limit_i \quad \forall i \in \{1, 2, ..., N\}
   \]

3. **Exchange Rates:**
   The amounts exchanged must comply with the currency exchange rates:
   \[
   x_{i,j} \leq rate_{i,j} \cdot y_i \quad \forall i, j \in \{1, 2, ..., N\}
   \]

4. **Non-negativity:**
   All exchanged amounts and final amounts must be non-negative:
   \[
   x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad y_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i, j \in \{1, 2, ..., N\}
   \]

######### Summary:
The Linear Programming problem can be summarized as:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Maximize } & y_N \\
\text{subject to } & y_i = start_i + \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{j,i} - \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j}, \quad \forall i \\
& \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} + \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{j,i} \leq limit_i, \quad \forall i \\
& x_{i,j} \leq rate_{i,j} \cdot y_i, \quad \forall i, j \\
& x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad y_i \geq 0, \quad \forall i, j 
\end{align*}
