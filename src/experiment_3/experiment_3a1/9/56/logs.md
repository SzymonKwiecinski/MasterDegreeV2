PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for the Delivery Problem}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $W$ denote the total number of avenues.
    \item Let $N$ denote the total number of streets.
    \item Let $west\_time_{n,w}$ denote the time to move from the intersection of the $w$th Avenue and $n$th Street to the $w+1$th Avenue and $n$th Street.
    \item Let $north\_time_{n,w}$ denote the time to move from the intersection of the $w$th Avenue and $n$th Street to the $w$th Avenue and $n+1$th Street.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let $x_{n,w}$ be a binary variable defined as follows:
\[
x_{n,w} =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if the delivery person moves from (n, w) to (n+1, w)} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Let $y_{n,w}$ be a binary variable defined as follows:
\[
y_{n,w} =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if the delivery person moves from (n, w) to (n, w+1)} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to minimize the total travel time:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} (north\_time_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w} + west\_time_{n,w} \cdot y_{n,w})
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
The constraints ensure the delivery person moves from the starting point (1,1) to the destination (N,W):

1. Flow conservation constraints for each intersection:
\[
\sum_{w=1}^{W-1} y_{1,w} = 1 \quad \text{(Start moving east from (1,1))}
\]
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} x_{n,1} = 1 \quad \text{(Start moving north from (1,1))}
\]

2. Ensure movement only occurs if there's a corresponding variable:
\[
\sum_{w=1}^{W-1} y_{n,w} - \sum_{w=1}^{W} x_{n,w-1} = 0 \quad \forall n = 1, \ldots, N-1
\]
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} x_{n,w} - \sum_{n=1}^{N} y_{n,w-1} = 0 \quad \forall w = 1, \ldots, W-1
\]

3. Non-negativity and binary constraints:
\[
x_{n,w} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad y_{n,w} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall n, w
\]

\subsection*{Output}
The output will consist of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Paths: $\text{paths} = [(street_n, avenue_w) \text{ for all } id \text{ in } 1,\ldots,m]$
    \item Total Time: $\text{total_time} = Z$
\end{itemize}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
Here's the Python script using the Pulp library based on the provided mathematical model and data:

```python
import pulp
import json

#### Data in JSON format as a python dictionary
data = {'west_time': [[3.5, 4.5], [4, 4], [5, 4]], 
        'north_time': [[10, 10, 9], [9, 9, 12]]}

#### Extracting parameters from the data
west_time = data['west_time']
north_time = data['north_time']
N = len(north_time) + 1  #### Number of streets
W = len(west_time[0]) + 1  #### Number of avenues

#### Create a linear programming problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Delivery_Problem", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision variables
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("x", ((n, w) for n in range(1, N) for w in range(1, W)), 0, 1, pulp.LpBinary)
y = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("y", ((n, w) for n in range(1, N) for w in range(1, W)), 0, 1, pulp.LpBinary)

#### Objective function
problem += pulp.lpSum(north_time[n-1][w-1] * x[n, w] + west_time[n-1][w-1] * y[n, w]
                       for n in range(1, N) for w in range(1, W))

#### Constraints
#### Starting point movement constraints
problem += pulp.lpSum(y[1, w] for w in range(1, W)) == 1  #### Start moving east from (1,1)
problem += pulp.lpSum(x[n, 1] for n in range(1, N)) == 1  #### Start moving north from (1,1)

#### Flow conservation constraints
for n in range(1, N):
    problem += (pulp.lpSum(y[n, w] for w in range(1, W)) ==
                pulp.lpSum(x[n, w-1] for w in range(1, W)))

for w in range(1, W):
    problem += (pulp.lpSum(x[n, w] for n in range(1, N)) ==
                pulp.lpSum(y[n-1, w] for n in range(1, N)))

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Output the paths and total time
paths = [(n, w) for n in range(1, N) for w in range(1, W) if pulp.value(x[n, w]) == 1 or pulp.value(y[n, w]) == 1]
total_time = pulp.value(problem.objective)

print(f'Paths: {paths}')
print(f'Total Time: {total_time}')
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

The above code defines a linear programming model for the delivery problem, sets up the data, and solves the problem. It prints the paths taken and the total time taken for the deliveries, including the objective value formatted as requested.
