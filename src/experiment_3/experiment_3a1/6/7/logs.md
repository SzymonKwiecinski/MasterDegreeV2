PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,

}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is max_t |a_t|. 

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "fuel_spend" contains the total fuel spent by the rocket

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_t \): position of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( v_t \): velocity of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( a_t \): acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( x_0 \): initial position of the rocket
    \item \( v_0 \): initial velocity of the rocket
    \item \( x_T \): target position of the rocket
    \item \( v_T \): target velocity of the rocket
    \item \( T \): final time
\end{itemize}

The dynamic equations of motion over discrete time increments can be expressed as:
\[
\begin{align*}
x_{t+1} & = x_t + v_t \\
v_{t+1} & = v_t + a_t
\end{align*}
\]

The goal is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is represented as:
\[
\text{Objective:} \quad \min \max_{t} |a_t|
\]

Subject to the initial conditions:
\[
\begin{align*}
x_0 & = x_0 \\
v_0 & = v_0 \\
\end{align*}
\]

And the boundary conditions at time \( T \):
\[
\begin{align*}
x_T & = x_T \\
v_T & = v_T \\
\end{align*}
\]

The fuel consumption is proportional to the absolute value of the acceleration:
\[
\text{Fuel spent:} \quad \text{fuel\_spent} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( a_t \): acceleration at time \( t \) for \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \)
    \item \( x_t \): position at time \( t \) for \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, T \)
    \item \( v_t \): velocity at time \( t \) for \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, T \)
\end{itemize}

Finally, the output format for the solution will be:
\[
\{
    \text{"x"}: [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T],
    \text{"v"}: [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T],
    \text{"a"}: [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T],
    \text{"fuel\_spend"}: \text{fuel\_spent}
