\section*{Rocket Motion Optimization Model}

We consider a rocket travelling along a straight path, where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_t \) is the position of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( v_t \) is the velocity of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( a_t \) is the acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \)
\end{itemize}

The discrete-time model for the rocket's motion is defined as:
\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]
\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

We assume that the acceleration \( a_t \) is under our control and its magnitude \( |a_t| \) is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \( t \).

Given the initial conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_0 \): initial position
    \item \( v_0 \): initial velocity
\end{itemize}

The objective is to guide the rocket to a target position \( x_T \) with speed \( v_T \) at time \( T \).

We aim to minimize the total fuel consumed, expressed as:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

Subject to the constraints:
\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 
\]
\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 
\]
\[
x_T = x_T \quad (target \, position)
\]
\[
v_T = v_T \quad (target \, velocity)
\]

The output format will be:
\[
\{
    "x": [x_i \text{ for } i=1, \ldots, T],
    "v": [v_i \text{ for } i=1, \ldots, T],
    "a": [a_i \text{ for } i=1, \ldots, T],
    "fuel\_spend": fuel\_spent,
\}
\]
