PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

\section*{Rocket Motion Optimization Model}

We consider a rocket travelling along a straight path, where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_t \) is the position of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( v_t \) is the velocity of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( a_t \) is the acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \)
\end{itemize}

The discrete-time model for the rocket's motion is defined as:
\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]
\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

We assume that the acceleration \( a_t \) is under our control and its magnitude \( |a_t| \) is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \( t \).

Given the initial conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_0 \): initial position
    \item \( v_0 \): initial velocity
\end{itemize}

The objective is to guide the rocket to a target position \( x_T \) with speed \( v_T \) at time \( T \).

We aim to minimize the total fuel consumed, expressed as:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

Subject to the constraints:
\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 
\]
\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 
\]
\[
x_T = x_T \quad (target \, position)
\]
\[
v_T = v_T \quad (target \, velocity)
\]

The output format will be:
\[
\{
    "x": [x_i \text{ for } i=1, \ldots, T],
    "v": [v_i \text{ for } i=1, \ldots, T],
    "a": [a_i \text{ for } i=1, \ldots, T],
    "fuel\_spend": fuel\_spent,
