PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Delivery Person's Path Optimization}

\subsection*{Problem Description}

A delivery person starts at the intersection of \(1^{\text{st}}\) Avenue and \(1^{\text{st}}\) Street and needs to reach the intersection of \(W^{\text{th}}\) Avenue and \(N^{\text{th}}\) Street on an \( (N-1) \times (W-1) \) grid. Each block has unique walking times due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour. The delivery person can only walk north or west.

\subsection*{Variables}

Define \(x_{n,w}\) as the binary decision variable where:

\[
x_{n,w} = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if the delivery person moves to the intersection of } w^{\text{th}} \text{ Avenue and } n^{\text{th}} \text{ Street} \\
0 & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
\]

\subsection*{Objective Function}

The objective is to minimize the total travel time:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} (north\_time_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w} + west\_time_{n,w} \cdot x_{n-1,w}) 
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. **Flow Conservation:**

   At each intersection, the flow into the intersection must equal the flow out. 

   For all \(n = 1, \ldots, N\) and \(w = 1, \ldots, W-1\):
   \[
   \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} x_{n,w} - \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} x_{n,w-1} = 0
   \]

2. **Start and End Points:**

   - At the start point \(x_{1,1} = 1\).
   - At the end point \(x_{N,W} = 1\) ensuring that the delivery person reaches the destination.

3. **Non-negativity:**

   \[
   x_{n,w} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall n, w
   \]

\subsection*{Output}

- The set of paths \( \text{paths} = \{(street_n, avenue_w) \mid x_{n,w} = 1\} \) for \(id = 1, \ldots, m\).
- The total time is given by \( \text{total_time} = Z \).
