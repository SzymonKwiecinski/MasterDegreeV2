PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Suppose that there are \var{N} available currencies, and assume that one unit of currency \var{i} can be exchanged for \var{rate_{i,j}} units of currency \var{j} (Naturally, we assume that \var{rate_{i,j}} > 0).
- There are also certain regulations that impose a limit \var{limit_i} on the total amount of currency \var{i} that can be exchanged (whether to other currencies or from other currencies) on any given day.
- Suppose that we start the day with \var{start_i} units of currency \var{i}
- Provide a linear programming formulation of this problem. Assume that for any sequence \var{i_1}, â€¦ ,\var{i_k} of currencies, we have \var{rate_{i_1,i_2}}, \var{rate_{i_2,i_3}}, ..., \var{rate_{i_{k-1}, i_{k}}, \var{rate_{i_k, i_1}} <= 1, which means that wealth cannot be multiplied by going through a cycle of currencies.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "start": [start_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "limit": [limit_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "rate": [[rate_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., N] for i in 1, ..., N],
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to maximize the number of units of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day, through a sequence of currency transactions.

OUTPUT INFO: 

- The output json file contains a list of transactions, where each transaction is a json object with the following fields:
    - from: the currency that we are exchanging from
    - to: the currency that we are exchanging to
    - amount: the amount of currency that we are exchanging
- The output json file also contains the final amount of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day.

OUTPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": i,
            "to": j,
            "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
    ],
    "final_amount_of_currency_N": final_amount_of_currency_N

\section*{Linear Programming Formulation}

Let \( N \) be the number of available currencies, indexed by \( i \) where \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, N \). 

Define the following variables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_{i,j} \): Amount of currency \( i \) exchanged to currency \( j \).
    \item \( y_i \): Total amount of currency \( i \) held at the end of the day.
\end{itemize}

Given parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{start}_i \): Initial amount of currency \( i \).
    \item \( \text{limit}_i \): Limit on the exchanged amount of currency \( i \).
    \item \( \text{rate}_{i,j} \): Exchange rate from currency \( i \) to currency \( j \) (where \( \text{rate}_{i,j} > 0 \)).
\end{itemize}

The objective is to maximize the total amount of currency \( N \) held at the end of the day:
\[
\text{Maximize } y_N
\]

Subject to the following constraints:

1. **Balance equations** for each currency:
\[
y_i = \text{start}_i - \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} + \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{j,i}, \quad \forall i = 1, 2, \ldots, N
\]

2. **Exchange limits** for each currency:
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} \leq \text{limit}_i, \quad \forall i = 1, 2, \ldots, N
\]

3. **Non-negativity constraints**:
\[
x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall i, j = 1, 2, \ldots, N
\]

4. **Cycle constraints** (to ensure we do not multiply wealth through cycles):
\[
\text{rate}_{i_1,i_2} \cdot \text{rate}_{i_2,i_3} \cdots \text{rate}_{i_{k-1},i_k} \cdot \text{rate}_{i_k,i_1} \leq 1, \quad \text{for any cycle } i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k
\]

The optimal solution of the linear program will yield the transactions and the maximum amount of currency \( N \) that can be held by the end of the day.
