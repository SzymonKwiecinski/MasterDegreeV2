PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT:

    "v_0": v_0,

    "v_T": v_T,

}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the total fuel \sum_{t=0}^{\var{T}-1} |\var{a_t}| spent subject to the preceding constraints.

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}

- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}

\textbf{Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( x_t \) be the position of the rocket at time \( t \).
    \item Let \( v_t \) be the velocity of the rocket at time \( t \).
    \item Let \( a_t \) be the acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), which is under our control.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dynamics Model:}
The dynamics of the rocket can be described by the following equations:
\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t
\end{align}

\textbf{Initial Conditions:}
The initial conditions are given as:
\begin{align*}
    x_0 &= \text{initial position} \\
    v_0 &= \text{initial velocity}
\end{align*}

\textbf{Target Conditions:}
We wish to reach the target position \( x_T \) with target velocity \( v_T \) at time \( T \):
\begin{align*}
    x_T &= \text{target position} \\
    v_T &= \text{target velocity}
\end{align*}

\textbf{Objective Function:}
The objective is to minimize the total fuel consumed:
\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}
The variables must satisfy the following constraints:
\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
    x_0 &= \text{given} \\
    v_0 &= \text{given} \\
    x_T &= \text{target position} \\
    v_T &= \text{target velocity}
\end{align}

\textbf{Output:}
The output consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A list of positions: \( x = [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T] \)
    \item A list of velocities: \( v = [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T] \)
    \item A list of accelerations: \( a = [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T] \)
    \item Total fuel spent: \( \text{fuel\_spend} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t| \)
