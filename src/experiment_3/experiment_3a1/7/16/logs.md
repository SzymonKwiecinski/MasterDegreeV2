PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- A manager of an oil refinery has \var{allocated_i} million barrels of crude oil type \var{i} allocated for production during the coming month. 
- These resources can be used to make \var{P} different products. product \var{p} sells for $ \var{price_p} per barrel.
- There are \var{L} production processes. Process \var{l} uses \var{input_l_i} barrels of each crude \var{i}, and produces \var{output_l_p} barrels of each product \var{p}. 
- Process \var{l} has a cost of \var{cost_l} per barrel of product produced.
- All \var{input_l_i} quantities and \var{output_l_p} quanitites are in barrels. 
- There are no separate cost items for the cost of the crudes, as they have already been allocated.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "allocated": [allocated_i for i in 1, ..., O],
    "price": [price_p for p in 1, ..., P],
    "input": [[input_l_i for i in 1, ..., O] for l in 1, ..., L],
    "output": [[output_l_p for p in 1, ..., P] for l in 1, ..., L],
    "cost": [cost_l for l in 1, ..., L]
}

OBJECTIVE: We want to know how many times should we execute each process to maximize the revenue for the next month (you can assume that the number of times that each process is executed is a floating point number)

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{revenue} is the total revenue for the month.
- \var{execute_l} is the number of times that process \var{l} should be executed.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "revenue": revenue,
    "execute": [execute_l for l in 1, ..., L]
}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Oil Refinery Production}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}

Let \( x_l \) be the number of times process \( l \) is executed, where \( l = 1, \ldots, L \).

\textbf{Parameters:}

- \( O \): Number of crude oil types
- \( P \): Number of products
- \( L \): Number of production processes
- \( allocated_i \): Allocated crude oil type \( i \) in million barrels
- \( price_p \): Selling price of product \( p \) per barrel
- \( input_{l,i} \): Input of crude oil type \( i \) required by process \( l \) in barrels
- \( output_{l,p} \): Output of product \( p \) produced by process \( l \) in barrels
- \( cost_l \): Cost of executing process \( l \) per barrel of product produced

\textbf{Objective Function:}

We want to maximize the total revenue:

\[
\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{p=1}^{P} \left( price_p \cdot \sum_{l=1}^{L} output_{l,p} \cdot x_l \right) - \sum_{l=1}^{L} (cost_l \cdot \sum_{p=1}^{P} output_{l,p} \cdot x_l)
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}

The constraints for the model can be formulated as follows:

1. Resource Availability Constraints:
\[
\sum_{l=1}^{L} input_{l,i} \cdot x_l \leq allocated_i \quad \forall i=1,\ldots,O
\]

2. Non-negativity Constraints:
\[
x_l \geq 0 \quad \forall l=1,\ldots,L
\]

\textbf{Output:}

The expected outputs are:
- Total revenue \( revenue \)
- Number of times each process should be executed \( execute_l \)
