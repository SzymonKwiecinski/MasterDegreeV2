PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- A hospital wants to make a weekly night shift (12pm-8am) schedule for its nurses. 
- The demand for nurses for the night shift on day \var{j} = 1,...,7 is an integer \var{d_j}. 
- Every nurse works \var{period} days in a row on the night shift, followed by (7 - \var{period}) days off.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "period": period,
    "demand": [d_j for j in 1, ...,7]
}

OBJECTIVE: The goal is to find the minimal number of nurses the hospital needs to hire. 

OUTPUT INFO: 

- for each day \var{j} = 1,...,7, \var{start_j} which shows the number of nurses that start their period on day \var{j}.
- the total number of nurses hired.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "start": [start_j for j in 1, ...,7],
    "total": total
}

\title{MILP Model for Night Shift Nurse Scheduling}
\author{}

\maketitle

\section*{Problem Definition}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{period} \): The number of consecutive days a nurse works on the night shift.
    \item \( d_j \): The demand for nurses on day \( j \) where \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \).
    \item \( n \): Total number of nurses hired.
    \item \( x_j \): Number of nurses starting their shift on day \( j \), where \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Objective Function}

The objective is to minimize the total number of nurses hired:
\[
\text{Minimize } n = \sum_{j=1}^7 x_j
\]

\section*{Constraints}

For each day \( j \) (where \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \)), the demand must be satisfied:
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{\text{period}-1} x_{(j-i) \mod 7} \geq d_j \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, 7
\]

Where \( x_{(j-i) \mod 7} \) represents the number of nurses starting their shift on day \( (j-i) \) modulo 7, ensuring that the schedule wraps around the week.

\section*{Variable Definition}

The variables \( x_j \) are non-negative integers:
\[
x_j \geq 0 \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, 7
\]

\section*{Output Format}

The output will consist of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A list \( \text{start} = [x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7] \) indicating how many nurses start their shifts on each day.
    \item The total number of nurses hired, \( n \).
\end{itemize}
