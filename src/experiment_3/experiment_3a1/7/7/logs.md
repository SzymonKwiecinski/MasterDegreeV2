PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT:

    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,
    "T": T

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is max_t |a_t|. 

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "fuel_spend" contains the total fuel spent by the rocket

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "v": [v_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "a": [a_i for i in 1, ..., T],

\section*{Mathematical Model of the Rocket Problem}

\subsection*{Variables}
Let:
\begin{align*}
x_t & : \text{Position of the rocket at time } t \\
v_t & : \text{Velocity of the rocket at time } t \\
a_t & : \text{Acceleration of the rocket at time } t \\
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Parameters}
Given:
\begin{align*}
x_0 & : \text{Initial position of the rocket} \\
v_0 & : \text{Initial velocity of the rocket} \\
x_T & : \text{Target position of the rocket at time } T \\
v_T & : \text{Target velocity of the rocket at time } T \\
T & : \text{Total time steps} \\
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Dynamic Equations}
The dynamics of the rocket is described by the following equations:
\begin{align}
x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \label{eq:position} \\
v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t \label{eq:velocity}
\end{align}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\min \max_{t} |a_t| \label{eq:objective}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Constraints}
The final conditions we wish to achieve are:
\begin{align}
x_T &= x_T \label{eq:final_position} \\
v_T &= v_T \label{eq:final_velocity}
\end{align}

\subsection*{Fuel Consumption}
The fuel consumption is related to the acceleration as follows:
\begin{equation}
\text{Fuel Spent} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t| \label{eq:fuel}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Output Variables}
The output should contain:
\begin{align*}
x & : [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, ..., T] \\
v & : [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, ..., T] \\
a & : [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, ..., T] \\
