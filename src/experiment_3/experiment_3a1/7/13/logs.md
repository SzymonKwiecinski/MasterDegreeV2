PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- Consider a set \var{P} described by linear inequality constraints, that is:
 \var{P} = {\var{x} \in R^\var{N} | \var{a_i}^T x <= \var{b_i} , i = 1, ..., m}.

where \var{a_i} \in R^\var{N} and \var{b_i} \in R

- A ball with center \var{y} in R^\var{N} and radius \var{r} is defined as the set of all points within (Euclidean) distance \var{r} from \var{y}.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "A": [[a_i_j for j in 1, ..., n] for i in 1, ..., m],
    "b": [b_i for i in 1, ..., m]
}

OBJECTIVE: We are interested in finding a ball with the largest possible radius, which is entirely contained within the set \var{P} (The center of such a ball is called the Chebychev center of \var{P}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- center (list): The center of the ball as a list of floats of length \var{N}
- radius (float): The radius of the ball as a float

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "center": [y_j for j in 1, ..., n],
    "radius": r

\section*{Problem Formulation}

Consider a set \( P \) described by the following linear inequality constraints:

\[
P = \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^N \mid \mathbf{a}_i^T \mathbf{x} \leq b_i , \, i = 1, \ldots, m \}
\]

where \( \mathbf{a}_i \in \mathbb{R}^N \) and \( b_i \in \mathbb{R} \).

A ball with center \( \mathbf{y} \) in \( \mathbb{R}^N \) and radius \( r \) is defined as the set of all points within (Euclidean) distance \( r \) from \( \mathbf{y} \):

\[
B(\mathbf{y}, r) = \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^N \mid \|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\|_2 \leq r \}
\]

We seek to find a ball with the largest possible radius \( r \) that is entirely contained within the set \( P \). The center of such a ball is referred to as the Chebyshev center of \( P \).

\subsection*{Input Format}

Let \( A \) be a list of lists representing the coefficients of the constraints, and \( b \) be a list representing the bounds:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( A = [[a_{i,j} \text{ for } j = 1, \ldots, N] \text{ for } i = 1, \ldots, m] \)
    \item \( b = [b_i \text{ for } i = 1, \ldots, m] \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective}

We are interested in finding the center \( \mathbf{y} \) and the radius \( r \) of the largest ball contained within the set \( P \).

\subsection*{Output Format}

The output can be represented as follows:

\[
\text{Output} = \{ 
    \text{"center"}: [y_j \text{ for } j = 1, \ldots, N], 
    \text{"radius"}: r 
\}
\]
