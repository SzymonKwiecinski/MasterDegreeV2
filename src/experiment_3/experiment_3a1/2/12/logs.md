PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Suppose that there are \var{N} available currencies, and assume that one unit of currency \var{i} can be exchanged for \var{rate_{i,j}} units of currency \var{j} (Naturally, we assume that \var{rate_{i,j}} > 0).
- There are also certain regulations that impose a limit \var{limit_i} on the total amount of currency \var{i} that can be exchanged (whether to other currencies or from other currencies) on any given day.
- Suppose that we start the day with \var{start_i} units of currency \var{i}
- Provide a linear programming formulation of this problem. Assume that for any sequence \var{i_1}, â€¦ ,\var{i_k} of currencies, we have \var{rate_{i_1,i_2}}, \var{rate_{i_2,i_3}}, ..., \var{rate_{i_{k-1}, i_{k}}, \var{rate_{i_k, i_1}} <= 1, which means that wealth cannot be multiplied by going through a cycle of currencies.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "start": [start_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "limit": [limit_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "rate": [[rate_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., N] for i in 1, ..., N],
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to maximize the number of units of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day, through a sequence of currency transactions.

OUTPUT INFO: 

- The output json file contains a list of transactions, where each transaction is a json object with the following fields:
    - from: the currency that we are exchanging from
    - to: the currency that we are exchanging to
    - amount: the amount of currency that we are exchanging
- The output json file also contains the final amount of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day.

    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": i,

\section*{Linear Programming Formulation}

Let \( N \) be the number of available currencies, indexed by \( i = 1, \ldots, N \). We define the following variables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_{i,j} \): amount of currency \( i \) exchanged for currency \( j \).
\end{itemize}

We start the day with \( \text{start}_i \) units of currency \( i \), and there are limitations on the amounts that can be exchanged due to regulations, represented by \( \text{limit}_i \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}

The objective is to maximize the amount of currency \( N \) at the end of the day:

\[
\text{Maximize} \quad z = \text{final\_amount\_of\_currency\_N}
\]

Where the final amount of currency \( N \) is given by:

\[
\text{final\_amount\_of\_currency\_N} = \text{start}_N + \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{N,j} - \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{j,N}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. **Initial Amount Constraint:**
   Each currency after transactions should respect the initial amount and transactions:
   \[
   \text{start}_i + \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} - \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{j,i} \geq 0 \quad \forall i
   \]

2. **Limit Constraint:**
   Each currency exchange must not exceed the specified limit:
   \[
   \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} + \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{j,i} \leq \text{limit}_i \quad \forall i
   \]

3. **Exchange Rate Constraint:**
   The amount exchanged must respect the exchange rates:
   \[
   x_{i,j} \leq \text{rate}_{i,j} \cdot \text{start}_i \quad \forall i,j
   \]

4. **Non-negativity Constraint:**
   The amount exchanged must be non-negative:
   \[
   x_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \forall i,j
   \]

5. **Cycle Wealth Constraint:**
   To ensure that the wealth cannot be multiplied by going through a cycle of currencies:
   \[
   \text{rate}_{i_1,i_2}, \text{rate}_{i_2,i_3}, \ldots, \text{rate}_{i_{k-1},i_k}, \text{rate}_{i_k,i_1} \leq 1 \quad \forall \text{cycle }
\]

\subsection*{Final Output}

The output will be structured as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": i,
            "to": j,
            "amount": x_{i,j}
        }
    ],
    "final_amount_of_currency_N": z
