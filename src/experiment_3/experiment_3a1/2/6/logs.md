PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the total fuel \sum_{t=0}^{\var{T}-1} |\var{a_t}| spent subject to the preceding constraints.

\section*{Rocket Motion Optimization Problem}

We define the following variables:
\begin{align*}
    x_t & : \text{position of the rocket at time } t, \\
    v_t & : \text{velocity of the rocket at time } t, \\
    a_t & : \text{acceleration of the rocket at time } t.
\end{align*}

The motion of the rocket is described by the following discrete-time equations:
\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t, \\
    v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t.
\end{align}

We want to control the acceleration \( a_t \) at each time step. We have the following initial conditions:
\begin{align*}
    x_0 & : \text{initial position}, \\
    v_0 & : \text{initial velocity}.
\end{align*}

The goal is to reach a target position \( x_T \) with a final velocity \( v_T \) at time \( T \):
\begin{align*}
    x_T & : \text{target position}, \\
    v_T & : \text{target velocity}.
\end{align*}

The optimization problem can be formulated as follows:

\textbf{Objective:}
Minimize the total fuel consumption (total acceleration) over the time period:
\begin{equation}
    \text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|.
\end{equation}

\textbf{Subject to:}
\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t, \quad & t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1, \\
    v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t, \quad & t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1, \\
    x_0 = & \text{given initial position}, \\
    v_0 = & \text{given initial velocity}, \\
    x_T = & \text{target position}, \\
    v_T = & \text{target velocity}.
\end{align}

The output should include:
\begin{align*}
    "x" & : \text{list of positions from } x_0 \text{ to } x_T, \\
    "v" & : \text{list of velocities from } v_0 \text{ to } v_T, \\
    "a" & : \text{list of accelerations over time,} \\
    "fuel\_spend" & : \text{total fuel spent}.
\end{align*}
