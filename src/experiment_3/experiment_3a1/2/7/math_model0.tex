\section*{Mathematical Model for Rocket Trajectory Control}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. We have the following relationships:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]

\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

We assume that the acceleration \( a_t \) is controlled through the rocket thrust. To minimize fuel consumption, we will also minimize the maximum required thrust, denoted as \( \max_t |a_t| \).

### Input Parameters

\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial position: \( x_0 \)
    \item Initial velocity: \( v_0 \)
    \item Target position: \( x_T \)
    \item Target velocity: \( v_T \)
    \item Time duration: \( T \)
\end{itemize}

### Objective Function

We wish to minimize the maximum thrust used during the flight:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \max_{t=0,1,\ldots,T} |a_t|
\]

### Constraints

The constraints for the model are derived from the position and velocity equations:

1. For \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \):
   \[
   x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
   \]
   \[
   v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
   \]

2. Initial conditions:
   \[
   x_0, \quad v_0
   \]

3. Final conditions (at time \( T \)):
   \[
   x_T = x_T, \quad v_T = v_T
   \]

4. Control limits for acceleration:
   \[
   -M \leq a_t \leq M \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T
   \]
   where \( M \) is a defined maximum thrust limit.

### Output Variables

Define the output variables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x = [x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_T] \) - positions at each time step
    \item \( v = [v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_T] \) - velocities at each time step
    \item \( a = [a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{T-1}] \) - accelerations at each time step
    \item \( \text{fuel\_spend} \) - total fuel spent by the rocket
\end{itemize}
