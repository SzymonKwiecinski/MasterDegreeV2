\section*{Linear Programming Model for School Assignment Problem}

\textbf{Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N$: Number of neighborhoods
    \item $S$: Number of schools
    \item $G$: Number of grades
    \item $capacity_{s,g}$: Capacity of school $s$ for grade $g$
    \item $population_{n,g}$: Student population of neighborhood $n$ for grade $g$
    \item $d_{n,s}$: Distance from neighborhood $n$ to school $s$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\[
x_{n,s,g} \quad \text{(the number of students of grade } g \text{ in neighborhood } n \text{ assigned to school } s\text{)}
\]

\textbf{Objective Function:}
Minimize the total distance traveled by all students:
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad Z = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{s=1}^{S} \sum_{g=1}^{G} d_{n,s} \cdot x_{n,s,g}
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}

1. Capacity constraints for each school and grade:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n,s,g} \leq capacity_{s,g} \quad \forall s \in \{1, \ldots, S\}, g \in \{1, \ldots, G\}
\]

2. Demand constraints for each neighborhood and grade:
\[
\sum_{s=1}^{S} x_{n,s,g} = population_{n,g} \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}, g \in \{1, \ldots, G\}
\]

3. Non-negativity constraints:
\[
x_{n,s,g} \geq 0 \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}, s \in \{1, \ldots, S\}, g \in \{1, \ldots, G\}
\]

\textbf{Output:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $assignment$: the optimal values of $x_{n,s,g}$ for all $n$, $s$, $g$
    \item $total\_distance$: the total distance traveled by all students
\end{itemize}
