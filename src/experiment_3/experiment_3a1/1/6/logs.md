PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "x_0": x_0,
    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,
    "T": T
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the total fuel \sum_{t=0}^{\var{T}-1} |\var{a_t}| spent subject to the preceding constraints.

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "fuel_spend" contains the total fuel spent by the rocket

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "v": [v_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "a": [a_i for i in 1, ..., T],

\subsection*{Variables}
Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_t$: position of the rocket at time $t$,
    \item $v_t$: velocity of the rocket at time $t$,
    \item $a_t$: acceleration of the rocket at time $t$.

    \item Target position: $x_T$,
    \item Target velocity: $v_T$,

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Discrete-Time Model}
The discrete-time equations governing the motion of the rocket are:
\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1, \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1.
\end{align}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
We want to minimize the total fuel spent, which can be represented as:
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|.
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
The following constraints must be satisfied:
\begin{align}
    x_0 & = \text{initial position}, \\
    v_0 & = \text{initial velocity}, \\
    x_T & = \text{target position}, \\
    v_T & = \text{target velocity}.
\end{align}

\subsection*{Output Format}
The outputs should be structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x$: list of positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to $T$,
    \item $v$: list of velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to $T$,
    \item $a$: list of accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to $T$,
    \item fuel\_spend: total fuel spent by the rocket.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Final Output Structure}
\[

    "v": [v_i \text{ for } i = 1, \ldots, T],
    "a": [a_i \text{ for } i = 1, \ldots, T],
    "fuel\_spend": \text{fuel\_spent},
