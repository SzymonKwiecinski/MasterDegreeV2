PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A quantity y is known to depend on another quantity x. A set of corresponding values has been collected for x and y and is presented.
- The \var{k}-th y value takes \var{y_{k}} and the \var{k}-th x value takes \var{x_{k}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "y": [y_{k} for k = 1,...,K],
    "x": [x_{k} for k = 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Fit the ‘best’ straight line y = bx + a to this set of data points. The objective is to minimise the sum of absolute deviations of each observed value of y from the value predicted by the linear relationship.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{intercept} represents the intercept of the fitted line
- \var{slope} represents the slope of the fitted line

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

Given a set of data points $(x_k, y_k)$ for $k = 1, \ldots, K$, we aim to fit the best straight line of the form:

\[
y = bx + a
\]

where \( b \) is the slope and \( a \) is the intercept. Our objective is to minimize the sum of absolute deviations of the observed values \( y_k \) from the predicted values given by the equation of the line.

\subsection*{Objective Function}

We define the absolute deviations for each observed value as follows:

\[
d_k = y_k - (bx_k + a) \quad \text{for } k = 1, \ldots, K
\]

The objective function can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} |d_k| = \sum_{k=1}^{K} |y_k - (bx_k + a)|
\]

To facilitate the optimization process, we introduce auxiliary variables \( e_k \) such that:

\[
e_k \geq y_k - (bx_k + a) \quad \text{(upper bound)}
\]
\[
e_k \geq -(y_k - (bx_k + a)) \quad \text{(lower bound)}
\]

Thus, our objective can be reformulated to minimizing the sum of these auxiliary variables:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} e_k
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

We need to satisfy the following constraints for each observation:

\[
e_k \geq y_k - (bx_k + a) \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
\]
\[
e_k \geq -(y_k - (bx_k + a)) \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
\]

\subsection*{Variables}

The decision variables are:

- The slope \( b \)
- The intercept \( a \)
- The auxiliary variables \( e_k \) for \( k = 1, \ldots, K \)

\subsection*{Solution}

The output will provide the estimated values for the intercept and slope of the fitted line. 

In conclusion, the LP formulation can be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Objective: Minimize \( Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} e_k \)
    \item Subject to:
    \begin{align*}
        e_k & \geq y_k - (bx_k + a), \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K \\
        e_k & \geq -(y_k - (bx_k + a)), \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
    \end{align*}
