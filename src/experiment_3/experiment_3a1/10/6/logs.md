PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT:

}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the total fuel \sum_{t=0}^{\var{T}-1} |\var{a_t}| spent subject to the preceding constraints.

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively.

The discrete-time dynamics of the rocket can be described as follows:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]
\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

We control the acceleration \( a_t \) and its magnitude \( |a_t| \) is proportional to the fuel consumption at time \( t \).

Given the initial conditions:
\[
x_0, \quad v_0
\]

We aim to reach a target position \( x_T \) with speed \( v_T \) at time \( T \), expressed mathematically as:

\[
x_T = x_{T-1} + v_{T-1}
\]
\[
v_T = v_{T-1} + a_{T-1}
\]

The goal is to minimize the total fuel consumption over the time period, which can be stated as:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

Subject to the constraints:

1. \( x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t, \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \)
2. \( v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t, \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \)
3. \( x_T = x_{T-1} + v_{T-1} \)
4. \( v_T = v_{T-1} + a_{T-1} \)

With given inputs:
\[
\begin{align*}
x_0 & : \text{initial position} \\
v_0 & : \text{initial velocity} \\
x_T & : \text{target position} \\
v_T & : \text{target velocity} \\
T & : \text{total time}
\end{align*}
\]

The output will consist of:
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{"x"} & : [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T] \\
\text{"v"} & : [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T] \\
\text{"a"} & : [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T] \\
