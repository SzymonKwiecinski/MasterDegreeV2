\section*{Linear Programming Model}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( K \) be the number of industries.
    \item \( T \) be the time horizon (number of years).
    \item \( produce_{k,t} \) be the amount produced by industry \( k \) in year \( t \).
    \item \( buildcapa_{k,t} \) be the amount used to build capacity by industry \( k \) in year \( t \).
    \item \( stock_{k,t} \) be the stock held by industry \( k \) at the end of year \( t \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}

Maximize total production in the last two years:
\[
\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} (produce_{k,T-1} + produce_{k,T})
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. **Production Constraints for Each Industry**:
   For each industry \( k \) in year \( t \):
   \[
   produce_{k,t} \leq capacity_{k} + stock_{k,t-1}
   \]

2. **Input Requirements for Production**:
   For industry \( k \) in year \( t \):
   \[
   \sum_{j=1}^{K} inputone_{k,j} \cdot produce_{j,t-1} + manpowerone_{k} \cdot produce_{k,t} \leq stock_{k,t-1} + capacity_{k}
   \]

3. **Manpower Constraints**:
   The total manpower used in any year cannot exceed the available manpower limit:
   \[
   \sum_{k=1}^{K} manpowerone_{k} \cdot produce_{k,t} + \sum_{k=1}^{K} manpowertwo_{k} \cdot buildcapa_{k,t} \leq manpower\_limit
   \]

4. **Capacity Building**:
   To build capacity in year \( t \):
   \[
   buildcapa_{k,t} \leq stock_{k,t-1}
   \]

5. **Stock Dynamics**:
   The stock for each industry at the end of year \( t \) is given by:
   \[
   stock_{k,t} = stock_{k,t-1} + produce_{k,t} - \sum_{j=1}^{K} inputone_{j,k} \cdot produce_{j,t-1} - buildcapa_{k,t}
   \]

6. **Initial Conditions**:
   At year \( 0 \):
   \[
   stock_{k,0} = stock_{k}
   \]
   \[
   capacity_{k,0} = capacity_{k}
   \]

7. **Non-negativity Constraints**:
   \[
   produce_{k,t} \geq 0, \quad buildcapa_{k,t} \geq 0, \quad stock_{k,t} \geq 0
   \]
