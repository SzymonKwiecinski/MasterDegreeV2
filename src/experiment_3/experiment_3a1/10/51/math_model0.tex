\section*{Linear Programming Model for Custom Tees Advertising Campaign}

\textbf{Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $x_a$ be the number of clicks purchased from ad type $a$ (in thousands), for $a = 1, 2, \ldots, A$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $goal\_young$: Goal for clicks from visitors aged 18-25 (in thousands).
    \item $goal\_old$: Goal for clicks from visitors older than 25 (in thousands).
    \item $goal\_unique\_young$: Goal for unique clicks from visitors aged 18-25 (in thousands).
    \item $goal\_unique\_old$: Goal for unique clicks from visitors older than 25 (in thousands).
    \item $young\_click_a$: Estimated percentage of clicks from the 18-25 age range for ad type $a$.
    \item $old\_click_a$: Estimated percentage of clicks from older visitors for ad type $a$.
    \item $cost_a$: Cost of ad type $a$ per 1000 clicks.
    \item $max\_click_a$: Maximum allowable clicks for ad type $a$ (in thousands).
    \item $unique\_click_a$: Estimated percentage of unique visitors for ad type $a$.
    \item $budget$: Advertising budget.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective Function:}
Maximize the total unique clicks:
\[
\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{a=1}^{A} unique\_click_a \cdot x_a
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}
1. Total clicks from young visitors must meet the goal:
\[
\sum_{a=1}^{A} young\_click_a \cdot x_a \geq goal\_young
\]
2. Total clicks from old visitors must meet the goal:
\[
\sum_{a=1}^{A} old\_click_a \cdot x_a \geq goal\_old
\]
3. Total unique clicks from young visitors must meet the goal:
\[
\sum_{a=1}^{A} unique\_click_a \cdot x_a \geq goal\_unique\_young
\]
4. Total unique clicks from old visitors must meet the goal:
\[
\sum_{a=1}^{A} unique\_click_a \cdot x_a \geq goal\_unique\_old
\]
5. Clicks for each ad type should not exceed the maximum allowable clicks:
\[
x_a \leq max\_click_a \quad \forall a
\]
6. The total cost of the campaign must not exceed the budget:
\[
\sum_{a=1}^{A} cost_a \cdot x_a \leq budget
\]
7. Non-negativity constraints:
\[
x_a \geq 0 \quad \forall a
\]
