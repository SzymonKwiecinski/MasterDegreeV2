PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
        for id in 1, ..., m
    ],
    "total_cost": total_cost

\section*{Transportation Problem Model}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( n \): number of cities
    \item \( A \): set of all routes
    \item \( C_{i,j} \): transport cost per metric ton along route from city \( i \) to city \( j \)
    \item \( supply_k \): soybean supply at terminal city \( k \)
    \item \( demand_l \): soybean demand at destination city \( l \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let \( amount_{i,j} \) be the amount of soybeans shipped from city \( i \) to city \( j \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total transportation cost:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \cdot amount_{i,j}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. Supply constraints for each terminal city \( k \):
\[
\sum_{j \text{ s.t. } (k,j) \in A} amount_{k,j} \leq supply_k \quad \forall k
\]

2. Demand constraints for each destination city \( l \):
\[
\sum_{i \text{ s.t. } (i,l) \in A} amount_{i,l} \geq demand_l \quad \forall l
\]

3. Non-negativity constraints:
\[
amount_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \forall (i,j) \in A
\]

\subsection*{Output}
The output will consist of the amount of soybeans shipped from each route and the total transportation cost:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Distribution of soybeans:
    \[
    \text{distribution} = \left\{ \left\{ "from": i, "to": j, "amount": amount_{i,j} \right\} \text{ for } (i,j) \in A \right\}
    \]
    \item Total cost:
    \[
    \text{total\_cost} = Z
