PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time

\section*{Optimal Path Problem in a Grid}

Consider a delivery person starting at the intersection of the \(1^{st}\) Avenue and \(1^{st}\) Street, with the aim to reach the intersection of the \(W^{th}\) Avenue and \(N^{th}\) Street. The path forms an \((N-1) \times (W-1)\) grid, allowing movement only north or west.

\subsection*{Definitions}
Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{west\_time}_{n,w} \) be the time to move from the intersection of the \(w^{th}\) Avenue and \(n^{th}\) Street to the \( (w+1)^{th} \) Avenue and \(n^{th}\) Street.
    \item \( \text{north\_time}_{n,w} \) be the time to move from the intersection of the \(w^{th}\) Avenue and \(n^{th}\) Street to the \(w^{th}\) Avenue and \( (n+1)^{th} \) Street.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Input Format}
The input format is defined as follows:
\[
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Input: } & \{ \\
    & \quad \text{"west\_time": } [[\text{west}_{n,w} \text{ for } w \text{ in } 1, ..., W-1] \text{ for } n \text{ in } 1, ..., N], \\
    & \quad \text{"north\_time": } [[\text{north}_{n,w} \text{ for } w \text{ in } 1, ..., W] \text{ for } n \text{ in } 1, ..., N-1] \\
    & \}
\end{aligned}
\]

\subsection*{Objective}
The goal is to determine the optimal path for the delivery person to ensure that the package is delivered in the least amount of time. 

\subsection*{Variables}
Define:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_{n,w} \): binary variable indicating whether the path goes through the intersection of \(w^{th}\) Avenue and \(n^{th}\) Street.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The total time taken to travel this path can be represented as:
\[
\text{total\_time} = \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} (\text{west\_time}_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w} + \text{north\_time}_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w})
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The delivery person must leave from the start position \((1, 1)\) and reach the end position \((W, N)\).
    \item The person can only move to the next block either to the north or west.
    \item There should be continuity in the path taken.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Output Format}
The expected output format is:
\[
\{ 
    \text{"paths": } [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) \text{ for } id \text{ in } 1, ..., m], 
    \text{"total\_time": } total\_travel\_time 
\}
\]
