PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Consider the problem of operating a warehouse, by buying and selling the stock of a certain commodity, in order to maximize profit over a certain length of time, say several periods.
- The warehouse has a fixed capacity \var{capacity}, and there is a cost \var{holding_cost} per unit for holding stock for one period.
- The selling price, \var{price_{n}}$, of the commodity is known to fluctuate over a number of time periods. 
- In any period \var{n} the price holding for purchase is \var{cost_{n}}.
- The warehouse is originally empty and is required to be empty at the end of the last period.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"holding_cost": holding_cost,
	"price", [price_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"cost": [cost_{n} for n in 1,...,N]
}


OBJECTIVE: Determine the amount of buying and selling in each period to maximize the profit over the months

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{buyquantity} represents the amount of buying in each period
- \var{sellquantity} represents the amount of selling in each period
- \var{stock} represents the stock in each period, excluding the intial stock

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"buyquantity": [buyquantity_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"sellquantity": [sellquantity_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"stock": [stock_{n} for n in 1,...,N]

\section*{Problem Definition}

We consider a warehouse that operates for \(N\) periods, aiming to maximize profit through the buying and selling of a commodity while respecting certain constraints.

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(C\): the fixed capacity of the warehouse,
    \item \(h\): the holding cost per unit per period,
    \item \(p_n\): the selling price of the commodity in period \(n\),
    \item \(c_n\): the cost of the commodity for purchase in period \(n\),
    \item \(b_n\): the quantity bought in period \(n\),
    \item \(s_n\): the quantity sold in period \(n\),
    \item \(x_n\): the stock remaining in the warehouse at the end of period \(n\).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Objective Function}

The objective is to maximize the total profit over \(N\) periods, which can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (p_n s_n - c_n b_n - h x_n)
\]

\section*{Constraints}

1. **Capacity Constraint**: The stock at any time must not exceed the warehouse capacity.

\[
x_n = x_{n-1} + b_n - s_n \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}
\]

\[
x_n \leq C \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}
\]

2. **Non-negativity Constraints**: The quantities bought, sold, and stock must be non-negative.

\[
b_n \geq 0, \quad s_n \geq 0, \quad x_n \geq 0 \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}
\]

3. **Initial Condition**: The warehouse starts empty.

\[
x_0 = 0
\]

4. **Final Condition**: The warehouse must be empty at the end of the last period.

\[
x_N = 0
\]

\section*{Output Variables}

The solution will yield the following output:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(b_n\): the amount bought in each period.
    \item \(s_n\): the amount sold in each period.
    \item \(x_n\): the stock at the end of each period, excluding the initial stock.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Output Format}

The results are provided in the following format:

\[
\{
    \text{"buyquantity"}: [b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_N],
    \text{"sellquantity"}: [s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_N],
    \text{"stock"}: [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N]
\}
\]
