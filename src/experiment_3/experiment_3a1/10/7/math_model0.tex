\section*{Rocket Motion Linear Programming Model}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) be the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \). The dynamical equations governing the motion of the rocket are defined as follows:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]

\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

We aim to control the acceleration \( a_t \), which is related to the fuel consumption. Our goal is to minimize the maximum thrust required, represented as \( \max_t |a_t| \).

Given the initial conditions and target specifications, we define the following parameters:

- Initial position: \( x_0 \)
- Initial velocity: \( v_0 \)
- Target position: \( x_T \)
- Target velocity: \( v_T \)
- Total time: \( T \)

We can summarize the linear programming model as follows:

\subsection*{Objective Function}

Minimize the maximum thrust:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad M
\]

where:

\[
M \geq |a_t| \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. Initial conditions:
    \[
    x_0 \text{ (given)}, \quad v_0 \text{ (given)}
    \]

2. State update equations for each time step \( t \):
    \[
    x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
    \]

    \[
    v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
    \]

3. Final conditions:
    \[
    x_T = x_T \text{ (given)}, \quad v_T = v_T \text{ (given)}
    \]

4. Control variable bounds:
    \[
    -M \leq a_t \leq M \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T
    \]

\subsection*{Output Specification}

The outputs of the model will be:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{"x"} &: [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T] \\
\text{"v"} &: [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T] \\
\text{"a"} &: [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T] \\
\text{"fuel\_spend"} &: \text{Total fuel spent}
\end{align*}
\]
