\section*{Linear Programming Model to Fit a Line}

Given a set of observations for quantities \( x \) and \( y \) where \( k = 1, \ldots, K \):

\[
y_k \text{ for } k = 1, \ldots, K
\]
\[
x_k \text{ for } k = 1, \ldots, K
\]

The objective is to fit the best straight line of the form:

\[
y = bx + a
\]

where \( b \) is the slope and \( a \) is the intercept. We want to minimize the maximum deviation of the observed \( y_k \) values from the predicted \( y \) values based on the linear model.

Define the deviations \( d_k \) for each observation, which represent the difference between the observed values and the values predicted by the model:

\[
d_k = y_k - (bx_k + a)
\]

We aim to minimize the maximum deviation:

\[
\min \, t
\]

subject to the constraints:

\[
d_k \leq t \quad \forall k
\]
\[
-d_k \leq t \quad \forall k
\]

This leads us to the following inequalities:

\[
y_k - (bx_k + a) \leq t \quad \forall k
\]
\[
-(y_k - (bx_k + a)) \leq t \quad \forall k
\]

Thus, the formulation of our linear programming problem is:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize} & \quad t \\
\text{Subject to:} & \quad y_k - (bx_k + a) \leq t, \quad \forall k \\
& \quad -(y_k - (bx_k + a)) \leq t, \quad \forall k \\
& \quad b, a \text{ are parameters to be determined}
\end{align*}
\]

The solution to this problem will yield the values of \( a \) (intercept) and \( b \) (slope) of the best-fit line.
