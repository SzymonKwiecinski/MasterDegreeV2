PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Delivery Path Optimization}

\subsection*{Variables}
Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_{n,w} \) = time taken to move north at intersection \( (w, n) \)
    \item \( y_{n,w} \) = time taken to move west at intersection \( (w, n) \)
    \item \( T \) = total time taken for the journey from \( (1, 1) \) to \( (W, N) \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to minimize the total travel time:

\[
\text{Minimize } T = \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W} north\_time_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w} + \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} west\_time_{n,w} \cdot y_{n,w}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
The delivery person can either move north or west, thus ensuring that the flow through intersections is properly accounted for. The following constraints must hold:

1. Starting Point Constraint:
\[
x_{1,1} + y_{1,1} = 1
\]

2. Flow Conservation at Each Intersection \( (w, n) \):
\[
x_{n,w} + y_{n,w} = 1 \quad \text{for all } 1 \leq n \leq N-1, 1 \leq w \leq W
\]

3. End Point Constraint:
At the end of the journey, the total flow must equal 1:
\[
\sum_{w=1}^{W} x_{N,w} + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} y_{n,W} = 1
\]

\subsection*{Output}
The output format will include the paths taken and the total travel time:
\begin{verbatim}
{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m],
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}
