\section*{Rocket Trajectory Optimization Problem}

We define the variables involved in the rocket's motion as follows:

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The discrete-time model governing the rocket's motion is given by:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]

\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

We assume that the acceleration \( a_t \) is under our control and is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \( t \). Given the initial conditions, we have:

\[
x_0, \quad v_0
\]

Our goal is to reach a target position \( x_T \) with a final speed \( v_T \) at time \( T \). Therefore, the constraints can be formulated as:

\[
x_T = x_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} v_t
\]

\[
v_T = v_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} a_t
\]

The objective of the optimization problem is to minimize the total fuel consumption, expressed as:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Input Format}

The input to the problem is given by:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Input} = \{ \\
&\quad x_0, \\
&\quad v_0, \\
&\quad x_T, \\
&\quad v_T, \\
&\quad T \\
&\}
\end{aligned}
\]

\subsection*{Output Information}

The output should provide the following information:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Output} = \{ \\
&\quad "x": [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T], \\
&\quad "v": [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T], \\
&\quad "a": [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T], \\
&\quad "fuel\_spend": \text{fuel\_spent} \\
&\}
\end{aligned}
\]
