PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the total fuel \sum_{t=0}^{\var{T}-1} |\var{a_t}| spent subject to the preceding constraints.

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}

\section*{Rocket Trajectory Optimization Problem}

We define the variables involved in the rocket's motion as follows:

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The discrete-time model governing the rocket's motion is given by:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]

\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

We assume that the acceleration \( a_t \) is under our control and is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \( t \). Given the initial conditions, we have:

\[
x_0, \quad v_0
\]

Our goal is to reach a target position \( x_T \) with a final speed \( v_T \) at time \( T \). Therefore, the constraints can be formulated as:

\[
x_T = x_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} v_t
\]

\[
v_T = v_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} a_t
\]

The objective of the optimization problem is to minimize the total fuel consumption, expressed as:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Input Format}

The input to the problem is given by:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Input} = \{ \\
&\quad x_0, \\
&\quad v_0, \\
&\quad x_T, \\
&\quad v_T, \\
&\quad T \\
&\}
\end{aligned}
\]

\subsection*{Output Information}

The output should provide the following information:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Output} = \{ \\
&\quad "x": [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T], \\
&\quad "v": [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T], \\
&\quad "a": [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T], \\
&\quad "fuel\_spend": \text{fuel\_spent} \\
