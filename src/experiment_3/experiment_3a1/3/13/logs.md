PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- Consider a set \var{P} described by linear inequality constraints, that is:
 \var{P} = {\var{x} \in R^\var{N} | \var{a_i}^T x <= \var{b_i} , i = 1, ..., m}.

where \var{a_i} \in R^\var{N} and \var{b_i} \in R

- A ball with center \var{y} in R^\var{N} and radius \var{r} is defined as the set of all points within (Euclidean) distance \var{r} from \var{y}.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "A": [[a_i_j for j in 1, ..., n] for i in 1, ..., m],
    "b": [b_i for i in 1, ..., m]

OUTPUT INFO:

- center (list): The center of the ball as a list of floats of length \var{N}
- radius (float): The radius of the ball as a float

OUTPUT FORMAT:

\section*{Mathematical Model for Chebychev Center}

Let the feasible region \( P \) be defined as:

\[
P = \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^N \mid \mathbf{a}_i^T \mathbf{x} \leq b_i, \, i = 1, \ldots, m \}
\]

where \( \mathbf{a}_i \in \mathbb{R}^N \) and \( b_i \in \mathbb{R} \). 

We want to find a ball with center \( \mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^N \) and radius \( r \) such that the ball is entirely contained within \( P \). The ball is defined as:

\[
B(\mathbf{y}, r) = \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^N \mid \|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\|_2 \leq r \}
\]

To ensure that the ball is contained in the set \( P \), we require that for all points \( \mathbf{x} \) on the boundary of the ball, the following holds:

\[
\mathbf{a}_i^T (\mathbf{y} + r \mathbf{u}) \leq b_i \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, m
\]

where \( \mathbf{u} \) is a unit vector in the \( N \)-dimensional space such that \( \|\mathbf{u}\|_2 = 1 \).

Mathematically, we can express the optimization problem as follows:

\[
\text{Maximize } r
\]

Subject to:

\[
\mathbf{a}_i^T \mathbf{y} + r \cdot \mathbf{a}_i^T \mathbf{u} \leq b_i \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, m
\]

This leads to the constraints:

\[
r \cdot \mathbf{a}_i^T \mathbf{u} \leq b_i - \mathbf{a}_i^T \mathbf{y}, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, m
\]

Thus, for each direction \( \mathbf{u} \), we can derive different values of \( r \), and the overall optimization problem can be structured as:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \text{Find } \mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^N, r \in \mathbb{R} \\
& \text{such that } r = \min_{i} \frac{b_i - \mathbf{a}_i^T \mathbf{y}}{\mathbf{a}_i^T \mathbf{u}}
\end{aligned}
\]

This gives the center of the ball as \( \mathbf{y} \) and the radius \( r \), which represents the Chebychev center of the feasible region \( P \).

```
This code sets up the linear programming problem to find the Chebychev center based on the provided constraints and data. It constructs the objective function to maximize the radius \( r \) of the ball centered at \( \mathbf{y} \). After solving the problem, it prints the objective value, which represents the maximum radius of the inscribed ball.
