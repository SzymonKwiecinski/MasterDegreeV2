\section*{Linear Programming Model for Linear Regression}

Given the data pairs of \( (x_k, y_k) \) for \( k = 1, \ldots, K \), we want to fit a line described by the equation:

\[
y = bx + a
\]

where \( a \) is the intercept and \( b \) is the slope. Our goal is to minimize the maximum deviation between the observed values \( y_k \) and the predicted values \( \hat{y}_k = bx_k + a \).

Let \( d_k \) represent the deviation for each observation \( k \):

\[
d_k = y_k - (bx_k + a)
\]

To minimize the maximum deviation, we introduce an auxiliary variable \( M \) such that:

\[
d_k \leq M \quad \text{and} \quad -d_k \leq M \quad \forall k
\]

This leads to the following set of inequalities:

\[
y_k - (bx_k + a) \leq M \quad \forall k
\]
\[
-(y_k - (bx_k + a)) \leq M \quad \forall k
\]

The objective is to minimize \( M \).

\textbf{Objective Function:}

\[
\text{Minimize } M
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}

\[
y_k - bx_k - a \leq M \quad \forall k \in \{1, \ldots, K\}
\]
\[
-(y_k - bx_k - a) \leq M \quad \forall k \in \{1, \ldots, K\}
\]

\textbf{Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( a \): intercept of the fitted line
    \item \( b \): slope of the fitted line
    \item \( M \): maximum deviation
\end{itemize}

This linear programming formulation allows us to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that minimize the maximum deviation from the predicted line.
