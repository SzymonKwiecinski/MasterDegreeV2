PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"benefit": [[benefit_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...,K],
	"communication": [[communication_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
	"cost": [[cost_{l, m} for m in 1,...,L] for l in 1,...,L],
}


OBJECTIVE: Where should each department be located so as to minimize overall yearly cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{islocated_{k, l}} represents whether department \var{k} is relocated at city \var{l}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "islocated": [[islocated_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...K],
}

\section*{Mathematical Model for Department Relocation}

\subsection*{Sets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( K \) be the set of departments, indexed by \( k \).
    \item Let \( L \) be the set of potential relocation cities, indexed by \( l \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{benefit}_{k, l} \): Benefit for department \( k \) if relocated to city \( l \) (in thousands of pounds).
    \item \( \text{communication}_{k, j} \): Quantity of communication between department \( k \) and department \( j \).
    \item \( \text{cost}_{l, m} \): Unit cost of communication between city \( l \) and city \( m \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{islocated}_{k, l} \): Binary variable that equals 1 if department \( k \) is located in city \( l \), and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to minimize the overall yearly cost, defined as:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k \in K} \sum_{l \in L} \text{islocated}_{k, l} \left( \sum_{j \in K} \text{communication}_{k, j} \cdot \sum_{m \in L} \text{cost}_{l, m} \cdot \text{islocated}_{j, m} - \text{benefit}_{k, l} \right)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each department must be located in exactly one city:
    \[
    \sum_{l \in L} \text{islocated}_{k, l} = 1, \quad \forall k \in K
    \]
    
    \item No city may house more than three departments:
    \[
    \sum_{k \in K} \text{islocated}_{k, l} \leq 3, \quad \forall l \in L
    \]
    
    \item Ensure that \( \text{islocated}_{k, l} \) is binary:
    \[
    \text{islocated}_{k, l} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall k \in K, \, \forall l \in L
