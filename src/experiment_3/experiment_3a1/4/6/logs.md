PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT:

    "x_0": x_0,
    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,
    "T": T
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the total fuel \sum_{t=0}^{\var{T}-1} |\var{a_t}| spent subject to the preceding constraints.

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "fuel_spend" contains the total fuel spent by the rocket

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],

\section*{Mathematical Model for Rocket Motion}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The discrete-time model is given by the equations:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]
\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

The acceleration \( a_t \) is determined by the thrust of the rocket and is under our control. We aim to minimize the total fuel used, which is proportional to the magnitudes of acceleration:

\[
\text{Objective:} \quad \min \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

Subject to the following constraints:

- Initial conditions:
  \[
  x_0 \quad \text{(initial position)}
  \]
  \[
  v_0 \quad \text{(initial velocity)}
  \]

- Final conditions to reach the target:
  \[
  x_T \quad \text{(target position)}
  \]
  \[
  v_T \quad \text{(target velocity)}
  \]

- Time constraint:
  \[
  t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
  \]

Thus our problem can be summarized as follows:

\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize:} & \quad \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t| \\
\text{Subject to:} & \\
& x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
& v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
& x_0 \text{ given}, \quad v_0 \text{ given} \\
& x_T \text{ desired}, \quad v_T \text{ desired}
\end{align*}

The output of the model will provide:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A list of positions \( [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T] \)
    \item A list of velocities \( [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T] \)
    \item A list of accelerations \( [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T] \)
    \item Total fuel spent \( \text{fuel\_spent} \)
\end{itemize}
