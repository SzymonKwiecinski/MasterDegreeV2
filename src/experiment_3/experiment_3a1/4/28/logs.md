PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A quantity y is known to depend on another quantity x. A set of corresponding values has been collected for x and y and is presented.
- The \var{k}-th y value takes \var{y_{k}} and the \var{k}-th x value takes \var{x_{k}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "y": [y_{k} for k = 1,...,K],
    "x": [x_{k} for k = 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Fit the ‘best’ straight line y = bx + a to this set of data points. The objective is to minimise the sum of absolute deviations of each observed value of y from the value predicted by the linear relationship.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{intercept} represents the intercept of the fitted line
- \var{slope} represents the slope of the fitted line

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Best Fit Line}

Given a set of observations with corresponding values \( y_k \) and \( x_k \) for \( k = 1, \ldots, K \), we aim to fit a linear model of the form:

\[
y = bx + a
\]

where \( a \) is the intercept and \( b \) is the slope of the fitted line. 

The objective is to minimize the sum of the absolute deviations of the observed values of \( y \) from the values predicted by this linear relationship. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} |y_k - (bx_k + a)|
\]

To facilitate the optimization process, we introduce auxiliary variables \( d_k \) to represent the absolute deviations:

\[
d_k \geq y_k - (bx_k + a) \quad \forall k
\]
\[
d_k \geq -(y_k - (bx_k + a)) \quad \forall k
\]

This leads to the following linear programming formulation:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} d_k
\]

subject to:

\[
d_k \geq y_k - (bx_k + a) \quad \forall k
\]
\[
d_k \geq -(y_k - (bx_k + a)) \quad \forall k
\]

The output will be:

\[
\{ \text{intercept} = a, \text{slope} = b \}
\]
