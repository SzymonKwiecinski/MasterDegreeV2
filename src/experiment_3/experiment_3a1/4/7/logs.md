PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

\section*{Rocket Trajectory Optimization Problem}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) be the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The discrete-time model can be formulated as follows:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t
\end{align}

We are given the initial conditions:

\begin{align*}
    x_0 & = \text{initial position} \\
    v_0 & = \text{initial velocity} \\
\end{align*}

The objective is to reach a target position \( x_T \) with a target velocity \( v_T \) at time \( T \). The goal is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \max_{t=0}^{T} |a_t|
\]

\text{Subject to:}

\begin{align}
    x_T &= x_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} v_t \\
    v_T &= v_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} a_t
\end{align}

The variables are defined as follows:

- \( a_t \) is controlled acceleration, reflecting fuel consumption.
- We aim to minimize the fuel spent given by the maximum of the absolute values of acceleration over time.

The output of the model will be summarized as follows:

\begin{align*}
    \text{Output:} \\
    & \text{"x"}: [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T] \\
    & \text{"v"}: [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T] \\
    & \text{"a"}: [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T] \\
    & \text{"fuel\_spend"}: \text{total fuel spent by the rocket}
