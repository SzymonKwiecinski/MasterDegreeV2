PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Suppose that there are \var{N} available currencies, and assume that one unit of currency \var{i} can be exchanged for \var{rate_{i,j}} units of currency \var{j} (Naturally, we assume that \var{rate_{i,j}} > 0).
- There are also certain regulations that impose a limit \var{limit_i} on the total amount of currency \var{i} that can be exchanged (whether to other currencies or from other currencies) on any given day.
- Suppose that we start the day with \var{start_i} units of currency \var{i}
- Provide a linear programming formulation of this problem. Assume that for any sequence \var{i_1}, â€¦ ,\var{i_k} of currencies, we have \var{rate_{i_1,i_2}}, \var{rate_{i_2,i_3}}, ..., \var{rate_{i_{k-1}, i_{k}}, \var{rate_{i_k, i_1}} <= 1, which means that wealth cannot be multiplied by going through a cycle of currencies.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "start": [start_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "limit": [limit_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "rate": [[rate_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., N] for i in 1, ..., N],
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to maximize the number of units of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day, through a sequence of currency transactions.

OUTPUT INFO: 

- The output json file contains a list of transactions, where each transaction is a json object with the following fields:
    - from: the currency that we are exchanging from
    - to: the currency that we are exchanging to
    - amount: the amount of currency that we are exchanging
- The output json file also contains the final amount of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day.

OUTPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": i,
            "to": j,
            "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
    ],
    "final_amount_of_currency_N": final_amount_of_currency_N

Given the problem setup, we can formulate a linear programming model to maximize the total amount of currency at the end of the day. Let us define the necessary variables and constraints.

\section*{Variables}
Let \( x_{i,j} \) be the amount of currency \( i \) that is exchanged for currency \( j \).

\section*{Objective Function}
The objective is to maximize the total amount of currency \( N \) at the end of the day, which can be mathematically represented as:

\[
\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{start,j}
\]

where \( x_{start,j} \) is the final amount of currency \( j \) we hold at the end of the day.

\section*{Constraints}
1. **Exchange Limit**: The amount exchanged from or to each currency cannot exceed its limit:

\[
\sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} \leq limit_i \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
\]

2. **Starting Amount**: The amount of each currency at the start of the day must balance with the transactions made. Specifically, for each currency \( i \):

\[
start_i + \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{j,i} - \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} = x_{final,i} \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
\]

where \( x_{final,i} \) is the final amount of currency \( i \).

3. **Transaction Rates**: The exchange rates must be respected in the transactions:

\[
x_{i,j} \leq rate_{i,j} \cdot x_{start,i} \quad \forall i,j = 1, \ldots, N \text{ where } i \neq j
\]

4. **Non-negativity**: The exchanged amounts must be non-negative:

\[
x_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \forall i,j = 1, \ldots, N
\]

5. **Cycle Constraint**: Assuming \( rate_{i_1,i_2}, rate_{i_2,i_3}, \ldots, rate_{i_k,i_1} \leq 1 \) ensures that no wealth is created through cycles.

\section*{Summary}
The complete linear programming formulation to maximize the total currency can thus be summarized as:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Maximize } & Z = \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{final,j} \\
\text{subject to } & \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} \leq limit_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N \\
& start_i + \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{j,i} - \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} = x_{final,i}, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N \\
& x_{i,j} \leq rate_{i,j} \cdot x_{start,i}, \quad \forall i,j = 1, \ldots, N, i \neq j \\
& x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall i,j = 1, \ldots, N
\end{align*}
