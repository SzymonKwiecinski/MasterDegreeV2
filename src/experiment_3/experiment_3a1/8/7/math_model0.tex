\section*{Rocket Movement Problem}

\subsection*{Variables}
Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_t \) be the position of the rocket at time \( t \).
    \item \( v_t \) be the velocity of the rocket at time \( t \).
    \item \( a_t \) be the acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Model Formulation}
The discrete-time model of the rocket can be described by the following equations:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
\end{align}

The goal is to reach a target position \( x_T \) with velocity \( v_T \) at time \( T \) given the initial conditions \( x_0 \) and \( v_0 \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Our objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, expressed mathematically as:

\[
\min \max_{t} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
The constraints on our system based on the desired final state are:

\begin{align}
    x_T &= x_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} v_t \\
    v_T &= v_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} a_t
\end{align}

Additionally, we have the following constraints regarding the accelerations:

\[
|a_t| \leq A \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
\]

where \( A \) is the permissible thrust limit.

\subsection*{Input Format}
The input parameters are given as follows:

\[
\text{Input} = \{ x_0, v_0, x_T, v_T, T \}
\]

\subsection*{Output Format}
The output of the optimization problem is structured as:

\[
\text{Output} = \{ 
    x = [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T], 
    v = [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T], 
    a = [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T], 
    \text{fuel\_spend} = \text{total fuel spent}
\}
\]
