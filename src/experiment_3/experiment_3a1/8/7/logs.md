PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "x_0": x_0,
    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,
    "T": T
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is max_t |a_t|. 

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "fuel_spend" contains the total fuel spent by the rocket

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "v": [v_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "a": [a_i for i in 1, ..., T],

\section*{Rocket Movement Problem}

\subsection*{Variables}
Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_t \) be the position of the rocket at time \( t \).
    \item \( v_t \) be the velocity of the rocket at time \( t \).
    \item \( a_t \) be the acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Model Formulation}
The discrete-time model of the rocket can be described by the following equations:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
\end{align}

The goal is to reach a target position \( x_T \) with velocity \( v_T \) at time \( T \) given the initial conditions \( x_0 \) and \( v_0 \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Our objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, expressed mathematically as:

\[
\min \max_{t} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
The constraints on our system based on the desired final state are:

\begin{align}
    x_T &= x_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} v_t \\
    v_T &= v_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} a_t
\end{align}

Additionally, we have the following constraints regarding the accelerations:

\[
|a_t| \leq A \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
\]

where \( A \) is the permissible thrust limit.

\subsection*{Input Format}
The input parameters are given as follows:

\[
\text{Input} = \{ x_0, v_0, x_T, v_T, T \}
\]

\subsection*{Output Format}
The output of the optimization problem is structured as:

\[
\text{Output} = \{ 
    x = [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T], 
    v = [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T], 
    a = [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T], 
    \text{fuel\_spend} = \text{total fuel spent}
\}
