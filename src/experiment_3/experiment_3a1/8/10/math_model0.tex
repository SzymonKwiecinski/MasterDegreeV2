\section*{Mathematical Model for School Assignment Problem}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( N \): Number of neighborhoods
    \item \( S \): Number of schools
    \item \( G \): Number of grades at each school
    \item \( capacity_{s,g} \): Capacity of school \( s \) for grade \( g \)
    \item \( population_{n,g} \): Student population in neighborhood \( n \) for grade \( g \)
    \item \( d_{n,s} \): Distance from neighborhood \( n \) to school \( s \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let \( x_{n,s,g} \) be the number of students of grade \( g \) in neighborhood \( n \) assigned to school \( s \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total distance traveled by all students:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{s=1}^{S} \sum_{g=1}^{G} d_{n,s} \cdot x_{n,s,g}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. Capacity Constraints:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{g=1}^{G} x_{n,s,g} \leq capacity_{s,g}, \quad \forall s, g
\]

2. Demand Constraints:
\[
\sum_{s=1}^{S} x_{n,s,g} = population_{n,g}, \quad \forall n, g
\]

3. Non-negativity Constraints:
\[
x_{n,s,g} \geq 0, \quad \forall n, s, g
\]

\subsection*{Output}
The output should include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_{n,s,g} \): Number of students of grade \( g \) in neighborhood \( n \) assigned to school \( s \).
    \item \( total\_distance \): Total distance traveled by all students.
\end{itemize}
