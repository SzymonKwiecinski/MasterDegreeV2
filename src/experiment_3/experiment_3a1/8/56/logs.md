PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Delivery Path Optimization}

We define a grid where the delivery person navigates from the intersection of \(1\)th Avenue and \(1\)th Street to the intersection of \(W\)th Avenue and \(N\)th Street. The path taken is influenced by the walking times defined by two matrices: \(west\_time\) and \(north\_time\). The aim is to minimize the total walking time.

\subsection*{Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(N\): Total number of streets (vertical)
    \item \(W\): Total number of avenues (horizontal)
    \item \(west\_time_{n,w}\): Time to move from intersection \((w,n)\) to \((w+1,n)\)
    \item \(north\_time_{n,w}\): Time to move from intersection \((w,n)\) to \((w,n+1)\)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}

Let \(x_{n,w}\) represent the decision variable indicating whether the delivery person travels from intersection \((w,n)\) to \((w+1,n)\) (moves west) or from \((w,n)\) to \((w,n+1)\) (moves north).

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(x_{n,w} = 1\) if the path is taken from \((w,n)\) to \((w+1,n)\)
    \item \(y_{n,w} = 1\) if the path is taken from \((w,n)\) to \((w,n+1)\)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}

We want to minimize the total time taken:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} (west\_time_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w} + north\_time_{n,w} \cdot y_{n,w})
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

The constraints ensure that from each intersection, the delivery person can only move either west or north:

1. Flow conservation constraints
   \[
   \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} x_{n,w} + \sum_{w=1}^{W} y_{n,w} = 1 \quad \forall n \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N-1\}
   \]
   \[
   \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} x_{n,w} + \sum_{n=1}^{N} y_{n,w} = 1 \quad \forall w \in \{1, 2, \ldots, W-1\}
   \]

2. Non-negativity constraints
   \[
   x_{n,w} \geq 0 \quad \forall n, w
   \]
   \[
   y_{n,w} \geq 0 \quad \forall n, w
   \]

\subsection*{Output}

The output of the optimization will yield:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Paths: \((street_{n}, avenue_{w})\) for \(id \in \{1, \ldots, m\}\)
    \item Total time: \(total\_time\)
\end{itemize}

    \item \(W\): Total number of avenues (horizontal)
    \item \(west\_time_{n,w}\): Time to move from intersection \((w,n)\) to \((w+1,n)\)
    \item \(north\_time_{n,w}\): Time to move from intersection \((w,n)\) to \((w,n+1)\)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}

Let \(x_{n,w}\) represent the decision variable indicating whether the delivery person travels from intersection \((w,n)\) to \((w+1,n)\) (moves west) or from \((w,n)\) to \((w,n+1)\) (moves north).

    \item \(y_{n,w} = 1\) if the path is taken from \((w,n)\) to \((w,n+1)\)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}

We want to minimize the total time taken:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} (west\_time_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w} + north\_time_{n,w} \cdot y_{n,w})
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

The constraints ensure that from each intersection, the delivery person can only move either west or north:

1. Flow conservation constraints
   \[
   \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} x_{n,w} + \sum_{w=1}^{W} y_{n,w} = 1 \quad \forall n \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N-1\}
   \]
   \[
   \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} x_{n,w} + \sum_{n=1}^{N} y_{n,w} = 1 \quad \forall w \in \{1, 2, \ldots, W-1\}
   \]

2. Non-negativity constraints
   \[
   x_{n,w} \geq 0 \quad \forall n, w
   \]
   \[
   y_{n,w} \geq 0 \quad \forall n, w
   \]

\subsection*{Output}

The output of the optimization will yield:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Paths: \((street_{n}, avenue_{w})\) for \(id \in \{1, \ldots, m\}\)
    \item Total time: \(total\_time\)
