PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Suppose that there are \var{N} available currencies, and assume that one unit of currency \var{i} can be exchanged for \var{rate_{i,j}} units of currency \var{j} (Naturally, we assume that \var{rate_{i,j}} > 0).
- There are also certain regulations that impose a limit \var{limit_i} on the total amount of currency \var{i} that can be exchanged (whether to other currencies or from other currencies) on any given day.
- Suppose that we start the day with \var{start_i} units of currency \var{i}
- Provide a linear programming formulation of this problem. Assume that for any sequence \var{i_1}, â€¦ ,\var{i_k} of currencies, we have \var{rate_{i_1,i_2}}, \var{rate_{i_2,i_3}}, ..., \var{rate_{i_{k-1}, i_{k}}, \var{rate_{i_k, i_1}} <= 1, which means that wealth cannot be multiplied by going through a cycle of currencies.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "start": [start_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "limit": [limit_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "rate": [[rate_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., N] for i in 1, ..., N],
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to maximize the number of units of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day, through a sequence of currency transactions.

OUTPUT INFO: 

- The output json file contains a list of transactions, where each transaction is a json object with the following fields:
    - from: the currency that we are exchanging from
    - to: the currency that we are exchanging to
    - amount: the amount of currency that we are exchanging
- The output json file also contains the final amount of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day.

OUTPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": i,
            "to": j,
            "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
    ],
    "final_amount_of_currency_N": final_amount_of_currency_N

\section*{Linear Programming Formulation}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(N\) be the number of available currencies,
    \item \(x_{i,j}\) be the amount of currency \(i\) exchanged for currency \(j\),
    \item \(start_i\) be the starting amount of currency \(i\),
    \item \(limit_i\) be the limit on the amount of currency \(i\) that can be exchanged,
    \item \(rate_{i,j}\) be the exchange rate from currency \(i\) to currency \(j\).
\end{itemize}

We aim to maximize the total amount of currency \(N\) at the end of the day.

\subsection*{Objective Function}

The objective function to maximize is:
\[
\text{Maximize } z = x_{N, N} + \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{N,j}
\]
where \(x_{N, N}\) represents the amount of currency \(N\) retained after transactions and \(\sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{N,j}\) is the total amount of currency \(N\) obtained through exchanges with other currencies.

\subsection*{Subject to the following constraints:}

1. \textbf{Exchange Amount Constraints}:
   For each currency \(i\):
   \[
   \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} \leq limit_i, \quad \forall i = 1, 2, \ldots, N
   \]

2. \textbf{Starting Amount Constraints}:
   The amount exchanged from currency \(i\) must not exceed the starting amount:
   \[
   x_{i,j} \leq start_i, \quad \forall i = 1, 2, \ldots, N, \forall j = 1, 2, \ldots, N
   \]

3. \textbf{Exchange Rate Constraints}:
   The converted amounts must respect the exchange rates:
   \[
   x_{i,j} \cdot rate_{i,j} \leq x_{j,i}, \quad \forall i,j \text{ such that } i \neq j
   \]

4. \textbf{Non-negativity Constraints}:
   All exchanged amounts must be non-negative:
   \[
   x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall i, j
   \]

\subsection*{Final Amount of Currency N}

At the end of the day, the total amount of currency \(N\) will be calculated as:
\[
final\_amount\_of\_currency\_N = x_{N,N} + \sum_{j=1}^{N} (x_{N,j} \cdot rate_{N,j})
\]

This formulation captures the optimization problem of maximizing the total amount of currency \(N\) through a series of transactions while adhering to the specified constraints.
