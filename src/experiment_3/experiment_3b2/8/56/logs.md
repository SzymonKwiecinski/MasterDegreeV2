PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

## START MESSAGE 1 
### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we need to formulate a linear programming model to minimize the total travel time while adhering to the grid's constraints and available paths. Here's a mathematical model using the data and constraints provided. The variables and constraints are set such that the delivery person can only move north or west, and we aim to minimize the total travel time.

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

% Sets and parameters
Let \( N \) be the number of Streets, and \( W \) be the number of Avenues. \\
Let \( \text{west\_time}_{n,w} \) be the time to move west from the intersection of \( w \)th Avenue and \( n \)th Street. \\
Let \( \text{north\_time}_{n,w} \) be the time to move north from the intersection of \( w \)th Avenue and \( n \)th Street. \\

% Decision variables
Define \( x_{n,w}^{west} \) as a binary variable that is 1 if moving west from intersection \((n, w)\), 0 otherwise. \\
Define \( x_{n,w}^{north} \) as a binary variable that is 1 if moving north from intersection \((n, w)\), 0 otherwise. \\

% Objective function
\textbf{Minimize:} 
\[
\text{Total time} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} \text{west\_time}_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w}^{west} + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W} \text{north\_time}_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w}^{north}
\]

% Constraints
\textbf{Subject to:}
\begin{align*}
1. & \quad \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} x_{1,w}^{west} + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} x_{n,1}^{north} = m \\
2. & \quad \sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n,W-1}^{west} + \sum_{w=1}^{W} x_{N-1,w}^{north} = m \\
3. & \quad \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} x_{n,w}^{west} + x_{n,1}^{north} \leq 1 \quad \text{for all } n \\
4. & \quad \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} x_{n,w}^{north} + x_{1,w}^{west} \leq 1 \quad \text{for all } w \\
5. & \quad x_{n,w}^{west}, x_{n,w}^{north} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \text{for all } n,w
\end{align*}

\textbf{Explanation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The objective is to minimize the total travel time by choosing optimal paths.
    \item The constraints ensure that the delivery person starts from the initial position and reaches the destination by moving only northward or westward per the defined path constraints.
    \item Each path from \( (n, w) \) involves a binary decision of moving either north or west.
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

This mathematical model ensures that the delivery person reaches the destination in the least amount of time, considering all possible paths on the grid and any given walking times for westward and northward movements. The decision variables and constraints are carefully selected to adhere to the problem's restrictions, ensuring the correct path is chosen.

data_dict = json.loads(data)

#### Parameters
west_time = data_dict['west_time']  #### Time to move west

N = len(north_time) + 1  #### Number of Streets (including start)
W = len(west_time[0]) + 1  #### Number of Avenues (including start)
