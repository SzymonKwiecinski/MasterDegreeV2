PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements in future years. 
- Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. 
- In addition to this, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, which will reduce the need for workers in all categories.
- The estimated manpower requirements for manpower \var{k} in year \var{i} is \var{requirement_{k, i}}.
- The current strength of manpower \var{k} is \var{strength_{k}}.
- The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to recruitment, retraining, redundancy and short-time working in the next years.
- There is a natural wastage of labour. 
- A fairly large number of workers leave during their first year. After this, the rate is much smaller. 
- Taking this into account, the wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with less than one year's service is \var{lessonewaste_{k}}.
- The wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with more than one year's service is \var{moreonewaste_{k}}.
- There has been no recent recruitment and all workers in the current labour force have been employed for more than one year.
- It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. 
- In any one year, the numbers that can be recruited in manpower \var{k} is \var{recruit_{k}}.
- The redundancy payment to manpower \var{k} is \var{costredundancy_{k}}.
- It is possible to employ up to \var{num_overman} more workers over the whole company than are needed, but the extra costs per employee per year is \var{costoverman_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- Up to \var{num_shortwork} workers in each category of skill can be put on short-time working. 
- The cost of this (per employee per year) is \var{costshort_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of half a full-time employee.

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To formulate this problem as a linear programming model, we need to define the decision variables, the objective function, and the constraints. Let's break it down:

######### Decision Variables:
- \( \text{recruit}_{k, i} \): Number of new recruits for manpower \( k \) in year \( i \).
- \( \text{overmanning}_{k, i} \): Number of overmanned employees for manpower \( k \) in year \( i \).
- \( \text{short}_{k, i} \): Number of employees on short-time working for manpower \( k \) in year \( i \).
- \( \text{redundant}_{k, i} \): Number of redundant employees for manpower \( k \) in year \( i \).
- \( \text{total}_{k, i} \): Total number of employees in manpower \( k \) at the end of year \( i \).

######### Objective Function:
Minimize total costs, including recruitment, redundancy, overmanning, and short-time working:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize} \quad Z = & \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{i=1}^{I} \left( \text{costredundancy}_{k} \cdot \text{redundant}_{k, i} + \text{costoverman}_{k} \cdot \text{overmanning}_{k, i} \right.\\
& \left. + \text{costshort}_{k} \cdot \text{short}_{k, i} \right)
\end{align*}
\]

######### Constraints:
1. **Initial Condition**:  
   All current workers have more than one year of service:
   \[
   \text{total}_{k,0} = \text{strength}_{k} \quad \forall k
   \]

2. **Manpower Balance**:  
   For each year, the manpower at the start of the year plus new recruits and overmanning minus redundancy should meet the production requirements:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   \text{total}_{k,i} &= (1 - \text{moreonewaste}_{k}) \cdot \text{total}_{k,i-1} + \text{recruit}_{k,i} - \text{redundant}_{k,i} + \text{overmanning}_{k,i} \\
   \text{short}_{k,i} &\leq \text{num_shortwork} \\
   \end{align*}
   \]

3. **Service Requirements**:  
   The manpower available should meet half the short-time working and total recruited and current workforce:
   \[
   \text{requirement}_{k,i} \leq \text{total}_{k,i} + 0.5 \cdot \text{short}_{k,i} \quad \forall k, i
   \]

4. **Recruitment Limits**:  
   Limit on the number of recruits:
   \[
   \text{recruit}_{k,i} \leq \text{recruit}_{k} \quad \forall k, i
   \]

5. **Overmanning Limits**:  
   Limit the total number of overmanning across all categories:
   \[
   \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{overmanning}_{k, i} \leq \text{num_overman} \quad \forall i
   \]

6. **Non-Negativity**:  
   All decision variables must be non-negative:
   \[
   \text{recruit}_{k,i}, \text{overmanning}_{k,i}, \text{short}_{k,i}, \text{redundant}_{k,i}, \text{total}_{k,i} \geq 0 \quad \forall k, i
   \]

With these decision variables, objective function, and constraints, we can define the linear programming model in LaTeX:

& \text{total}_{k, i}: \text{Total number of employees in manpower } k \text{ at the end of year } i \\
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Objective Function}

& \left. + \text{costshort}_{k} \cdot \text{short}_{k, i} \right)
\end{align*}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{align*}
& \text{Initial Condition:} \quad \text{total}_{k,0} = \text{strength}_{k} \quad \forall k \\
& \text{Manpower Balance:} \quad \text{total}_{k,i} = (1 - \text{moreonewaste}_{k}) \cdot \text{total}_{k,i-1} + \text{recruit}_{k,i} \\

& \quad \quad \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{redundant}_{k,i}, \text{total}_{k,i} \geq 0 \quad \forall k, i
\end{align*}

This LaTeX file represents the linear programming model for minimizing the costs associated with manpower management in the company. The constraints ensure that the company meets its manpower requirements while adhering to limitations on recruitment, redundancy, overmanning, and short-time working.
