PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
        for id in 1, ..., m
    ],
    "total_cost": total_cost

The problem presented is a classic transportation problem, which is a type of linear programming problem. We need to determine the optimal quantities of soybeans to transport between cities through given routes while minimizing the total transportation cost. Here is the formulation of the problem in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Model}

\textbf{Indices:}
\begin{align*}
& i, j \in A \quad \text{(Routes set)} \\
& k \quad \text{(Source terminals index)} \\
& l \quad \text{(Destination cities index)} 
\end{align*}

\textbf{Parameters:}
\begin{align*}
& C_{i,j} \quad \text{Cost of transporting one metric ton from } i \text{ to } j \\
& supply_{k} \quad \text{Soybean supply at source terminal } k \\
& demand_{l} \quad \text{Soybean demand at destination city } l \\
\end{align*}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{align*}
& amount_{i,j} \quad \text{Amount of soybeans transported from } i \text{ to } j 
\end{align*}

\textbf{Objective Function:}
Minimize the total transportation cost:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \cdot amount_{i,j}
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}
\begin{align*}
& \text{(1) Supply Constraints:} \\
& \sum_{j:(k,j) \in A} amount_{k,j} \leq supply_{k}, \quad \forall k \\
& \text{(2) Demand Constraints:} \\
& \sum_{i:(i,l) \in A} amount_{i,l} \geq demand_{l}, \quad \forall l \\
& \text{(3) Non-negativity Constraints:} \\
& amount_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall (i,j) \in A 
\end{align*}

\end{document}
```

This formulation aims to minimize the total transportation costs, subject to supply constraints at each terminal and demand requirements at each destination. The decision variable `amount_{i,j}` represents the quantity of soybeans transported on the route from city `i` to city `j`. Constraints ensure that each source does not ship more than it has and each destination receives at least as much as it demands.
