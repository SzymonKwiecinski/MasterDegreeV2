PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A mining company is going to continue operating in a certain area for the next years. 
- There are \var{n_mines} mines in this area, but it can operate at most \var{n_maxwork} in any one year. 
- Although a mine may not operate in a certain year, it is still necessary to keep it ‘open’, in the sense that royalties are payable, if it be operated in a future year. 
- Clearly, if a mine is not going to be worked again, it can be permanently closed down and no more royalties need be paid. 
- The yearly royalties payable on each mine kept ‘open’ is \var{royalty_{k}} for mine \var{k}.
- There is an upper limit to the amount of ore, which can be extracted from each mine in a year. 
- The upper limit for mine \var{k} is \var{limit_{k}}.
- The ore from the different mines is of varying quality.
- This quality is measured on a scale so that blending ores together results in a linear combination of the quality measurements, for example, if equal quantities of two ores were combined, the resultant ore would have a quality measurement half way between
that of the ingredient ores. 
- The quality of ore from mine \var{k} is \var{quality_{k}}.
- In each year, it is necessary to combine the total outputs from each mine to produce a blended ore of exactly some stipulated quality.
- In year \var{i}, the required quality is \var{requiredquality_{i}}.
- The final blended ore sells for \var{price} ton each year. 
- Revenue and expenditure for future years must be discounted at a rate of \var{discount} per annum.

INPUT FORMAT:

OBJECTIVE: To maximize profit, which mines should be operated each year and how much should they produce?

OUTPUT INFO:

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this multi-year mining operation problem, we will formulate a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model. This model will help determine which mines should be operated each year and how much ore should be produced from each mine, with the objective to maximize discounted profit over the planning horizon.

Below is the LaTeX representation of the mathematical model for this problem:

\section*{Mathematical Model}

\subsection*{Indices}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $k = 1, \ldots, n_{\text{mines}}$: Index for mines
    \item $i = 1, \ldots, I$: Index for years
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n_{\text{maxwork}}$: Maximum number of mines that can be operated in any one year
    \item $\text{royalty}_k$: Yearly royalty payable if mine $k$ is kept open
    \item $\text{limit}_k$: Maximum amount of ore that can be extracted from mine $k$ in a year
    \item $\text{quality}_k$: Quality of ore from mine $k$
    \item $\text{requiredquality}_i$: Required quality of blended ore in year $i$
    \item $\text{price}$: Selling price per ton of ore
    \item $\text{discount}$: Discount rate per annum
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{k,i}$: Amount of ore produced from mine $k$ in year $i$
    \item $y_{k,i} \in \{0, 1\}$: Binary variable, 1 if mine $k$ is operated in year $i$, 0 otherwise
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Maximize the discounted profit:
\[
\max \sum_{i=1}^{I} \left( \frac{\text{price} \left(\sum_{k=1}^{n_{\text{mines}}} x_{k,i}\right) - \sum_{k=1}^{n_{\text{mines}}} \text{royalty}_k y_{k,i}}{(1 + \text{discount})^i} \right)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{align}
    & \sum_{k=1}^{n_{\text{mines}}} y_{k,i} \leq n_{\text{maxwork}}, && \forall i \label{eq:max_work}\\
    & x_{k,i} \leq \text{limit}_k \, y_{k,i}, && \forall k, \forall i \label{eq:limit}\\
    & \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n_{\text{mines}}} x_{k,i} \cdot \text{quality}_k}{\sum_{k=1}^{n_{\text{mines}}} x_{k,i}} = \text{requiredquality}_i, && \forall i \label{eq:quality}\\
    & y_{k,i} \leq y_{k,i-1}, && \forall k, \forall i > 1 \label{eq:operation_order}
\end{align}

\subsection*{Explanation of Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Constraint \eqref{eq:max_work} ensures that at most $n_{\text{maxwork}}$ mines are operated in any year.
    \item Constraint \eqref{eq:limit} ensures that the amount extracted from each mine does not exceed its limit and is zero if the mine is not operated.
    \item Constraint \eqref{eq:quality} ensures that the quality of the blended ore meets the required standard.
    \item Constraint \eqref{eq:operation_order} ensures a mine can only be operated if it was operated in the previous year.
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

This model maximizes the discounted profit over the given years, adhering to royal payment obligations, mine operational limitations, ore quality requirements, and ensuring the number of mines operating each year does not exceed the specified maximum.
