\section*{Rocket Fuel Minimization Problem}

We define the following variables:
- \( x_t \): Position of the rocket at time \( t \)
- \( v_t \): Velocity of the rocket at time \( t \)
- \( a_t \): Acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \)

Given:
- \( x_0 \) and \( v_0 \) as the initial position and velocity
- \( x_T \) and \( v_T \) as the target position and velocity at time \( T \)
- \( T \) as the time horizon

\subsection*{Objective:}
Minimize the total fuel consumption:
\[
\min \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints:}

1. Dynamics of the rocket:
   \[
   x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t \quad \forall t = 0, \ldots, T-1
   \]
   \[
   v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t \quad \forall t = 0, \ldots, T-1
   \]

2. Boundary conditions:
   \[
   x_0 = \text{given}
   \]
   \[
   v_0 = \text{given}
   \]
   \[
   x_T = \text{given}
   \]
   \[
   v_T = \text{given}
   \]

3. Absolute value constraint for accelerations:
   \[
   a_t^+ - a_t^- = a_t, \quad a_t^+, a_t^- \geq 0, \quad \forall t = 0, \ldots, T-1
   \]
   \[
   |a_t| = a_t^+ + a_t^-
   \]

With this setup, we formulate the LP as:
\[
\min \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} (a_t^+ + a_t^-)
\]
Subject to:
\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t \quad \forall t = 0, \ldots, T-1
\]
\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t \quad \forall t = 0, \ldots, T-1
\]
\[
a_t = a_t^+ - a_t^- \quad \forall t = 0, \ldots, T-1
\]
\[
a_t^+, a_t^- \geq 0 \quad \forall t = 0, \ldots, T-1
\]
\[
x_0 = \text{given}, \ v_0 = \text{given}
\]
\[
x_T = \text{given}, \ v_T = \text{given}
\]

This model can be solved by standard linear programming solvers to obtain the positions, velocities, accelerations, and the total fuel spent.
