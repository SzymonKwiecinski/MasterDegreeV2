PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

To solve this problem, we need to formulate it as a linear programming (LP) problem. The objective is to minimize the total fuel consumption, which is equivalent to minimizing the sum of the absolute values of the accelerations over the time period. Given the constraints on the dynamics of the rocket, we can establish an LP model as follows:

\section*{Rocket Fuel Minimization Problem}

We define the following variables:
- \( x_t \): Position of the rocket at time \( t \)
- \( v_t \): Velocity of the rocket at time \( t \)
- \( a_t \): Acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \)

Given:
- \( x_0 \) and \( v_0 \) as the initial position and velocity
- \( x_T \) and \( v_T \) as the target position and velocity at time \( T \)
- \( T \) as the time horizon

\subsection*{Objective:}
Minimize the total fuel consumption:
\[
\min \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints:}

1. Dynamics of the rocket:
   \[
   x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t \quad \forall t = 0, \ldots, T-1
   \]
   \[
   v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t \quad \forall t = 0, \ldots, T-1
   \]

2. Boundary conditions:
   \[
   x_0 = \text{given}
   \]
   \[
   v_0 = \text{given}
   \]
   \[
   x_T = \text{given}
   \]
   \[
   v_T = \text{given}
   \]

3. Absolute value constraint for accelerations:
   \[
   a_t^+ - a_t^- = a_t, \quad a_t^+, a_t^- \geq 0, \quad \forall t = 0, \ldots, T-1
   \]
   \[
   |a_t| = a_t^+ + a_t^-
   \]

With this setup, we formulate the LP as:
\[
\min \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} (a_t^+ + a_t^-)
\]
Subject to:
\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t \quad \forall t = 0, \ldots, T-1
\]
\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t \quad \forall t = 0, \ldots, T-1
\]
\[
a_t = a_t^+ - a_t^- \quad \forall t = 0, \ldots, T-1
\]
\[
a_t^+, a_t^- \geq 0 \quad \forall t = 0, \ldots, T-1
\]
\[
x_0 = \text{given}, \ v_0 = \text{given}
\]
\[
x_T = \text{given}, \ v_T = \text{given}
\]

This model can be solved by standard linear programming solvers to obtain the positions, velocities, accelerations, and the total fuel spent.

\end{document}
```

In this formulation, we use \(a_t^+\) and \(a_t^-\) to represent the positive and negative parts of \(a_t\) so that \(|a_t| = a_t^+ + a_t^-\). This allows us to maintain linearity suitable for LP solvers. The solution of the LP will provide the positions \(x\), velocities \(v\), accelerations \(a\), and the total fuel spent.

This model can be solved by standard linear programming solvers to obtain the positions, velocities, accelerations, and the total fuel spent.
