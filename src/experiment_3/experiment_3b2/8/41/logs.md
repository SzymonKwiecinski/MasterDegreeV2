<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, we need to define decision variables and constraints that accurately represent the distribution of files across the floppy disks while minimizing the number of disks used. Let's define the model:

**Decision Variables:**
- Let \( x_{ij} \) be a binary variable which is 1 if file \( j \) is placed on disk \( i \), and 0 otherwise.
- Let \( y_i \) be a binary variable which is 1 if disk \( i \) is used, and 0 otherwise.

**Objective:**
- Minimize the total number of disks used, i.e., \(\sum_{i} y_i\).

**Constraints:**
1. Each file must be placed on exactly one disk:
   \[
   \sum_{i} x_{ij} = 1 \quad \text{for each file } j
   \]
2. The total size of files placed on any disk cannot exceed its capacity:
   \[
   \sum_{j} \text{size}_{j} \times x_{ij} \leq \text{capacity} \times y_i \quad \text{for each disk } i
   \]
3. If any file is placed on disk \( i \), then disk \( i \) must be marked as used:
   \[
   x_{ij} \leq y_i \quad \text{for each disk } i \text{ and file } j
   \]

Let's express the model in LaTeX format:

\section*{MILP Model for Disk Usage Optimization}

\subsection*{Given:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\text{capacity}\): Capacity of each floppy disk in GB.
    \item \(\text{size}_j\): Size of file \(j\) in GB, \(j = 1, \ldots, N\).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective:}
Minimize the number of floppy disks used:
\[
\min \sum_{i=1}^{M} y_i
\]

\subsection*{Constraints:}
\begin{align}
    & \sum_{i=1}^{M} x_{ij} = 1, \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, N \\
    & \sum_{j=1}^{N} \text{size}_j \cdot x_{ij} \leq \text{capacity} \cdot y_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M \\
    & x_{ij} \leq y_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M, \, j = 1, \ldots, N \\
    & x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M, \, j = 1, \ldots, N \\
    & y_i \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M
\end{align}

\subsection*{Explanation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(x_{ij}\) is a binary variable indicating if file \(j\) is placed on disk \(i\).
    \item \(y_i\) is a binary variable indicating if disk \(i\) is used.
    \item Constraint (1) ensures each file is assigned to exactly one disk.
    \item Constraint (2) ensures that the total size of files on any disk does not exceed its capacity.
    \item Constraint (3) ensures that a disk is marked as used if any file is placed on it.
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

Note: \( M \) should be chosen as an upper bound on the number of disks that could potentially be needed, such as \( N \) (considering each file on a separate disk scenario).
