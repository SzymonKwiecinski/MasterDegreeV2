PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- The town has \var{S} different shifts for the police officers during the day.
- During each shift \var{s}, the town requires \var{officers_needed_{s}} police officers on duty.
- Each police officer works for two consecutive shifts.
- The cost for the town when starting a shift at \var{s} is \var{shift_cost_{s}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "officers_needed": [officers_needed_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "shift_costs": [shift_cost_{s} for s in 1, ..., S]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many officers should the town assign to each shift in order to minimize the total cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- The number of officers assigned to each shift \var{officers_assigned_{s}}.
- \var{total_cost} indicates the total cost for the town.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "officers_assigned": [officers_assigned_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we can formulate a Linear Programming (LP) model. We need to determine the number of officers to assign to each shift such that the total cost is minimized, while ensuring the town's requirement for police officers is met for each shift.

Let's denote:
- \( x_s \) as the number of officers starting their work at shift \( s \).

The objective is to minimize the total cost of assigning officers, represented by the sum of the product of officers assigned to each shift and the cost per shift.

The constraints ensure that the number of officers in each shift meets the required demand.

Here's the mathematical model in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( S \): Number of shifts.
    \item \( \text{officers\_needed}_s \): Number of officers needed for shift \( s \), for \( s = 1, \ldots, S \).
    \item \( \text{shift\_cost}_s \): Cost of assigning officers to start at shift \( s \), for \( s = 1, \ldots, S \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_s \): Number of officers starting their two-shift work at shift \( s \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total cost of assigning officers:
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad Z = \sum_{s=1}^{S} \text{shift\_cost}_s \cdot x_s
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Demand constraints for each shift:
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
        x_s + x_{s-1} & \geq \text{officers\_needed}_s, & \quad s = 1, \\
        x_2 + x_1 & \geq \text{officers\_needed}_2, \\
        & \vdots \\
        x_S + x_{S-1} & \geq \text{officers\_needed}_S, \\
        x_1 + x_S & \geq \text{officers\_needed}_1. 
    \end{aligned}
    \]
    (Assuming the schedule wraps around circularly, i.e., after shift \( S \), it returns to shift 1)
    
    \item Non-negativity constraints:
    \[
    x_s \geq 0, \quad s = 1, \ldots, S.
    \]
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

This model seeks the optimal number of officers to start each shift while minimizing the total cost and ensuring the required number of officers are on duty during each shift. Solving this LP will provide the number of officers to assign to each shift and the total minimized cost.
