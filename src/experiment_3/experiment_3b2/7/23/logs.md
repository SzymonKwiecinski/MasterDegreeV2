PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements in future years. 
- Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. 
- In addition to this, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, which will reduce the need for workers in all categories.
- The estimated manpower requirements for manpower \var{k} in year \var{i} is \var{requirement_{k, i}}.
- The current strength of manpower \var{k} is \var{strength_{k}}.
- The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to recruitment, retraining, redundancy and short-time working in the next years.
- There is a natural wastage of labour. 
- A fairly large number of workers leave during their first year. After this, the rate is much smaller. 
- Taking this into account, the wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with less than one year's service is \var{lessonewaste_{k}}.
- The wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with more than one year's service is \var{moreonewaste_{k}}.
- There has been no recent recruitment and all workers in the current labour force have been employed for more than one year.
- It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. 
- In any one year, the numbers that can be recruited in manpower \var{k} is \var{recruit_{k}}.
- The redundancy payment to manpower \var{k} is \var{costredundancy_{k}}.
- It is possible to employ up to \var{num_overman} more workers over the whole company than are needed, but the extra costs per employee per year is \var{costoverman_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- Up to \var{num_shortwork} workers in each category of skill can be put on short-time working. 
- The cost of this (per employee per year) is \var{costshort_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of half a full-time employee.

To create a mathematical model for this problem, we need to consider the variables, constraints, and objective defined in the problem. The primary goal is to minimize the company's costs associated with manpower adjustments over the given years. Here's the mathematical model in LaTeX format:

\section*{Mathematical Model}

\subsection*{Sets and Indices}
\begin{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $requirement_{k,i}$: Required manpower of type $k$ in year $i$.
    \item $strength_k$: Current strength of manpower type $k$.
    \item $lessonewaste_k$: Wastage rate for manpower type $k$ with less than one year's service.
    \item $moreonewaste_k$: Wastage rate for manpower type $k$ with more than one year's service.
    \item $recruit_k$: Maximum number of manpower type $k$ that can be recruited in a year.
    \item $costredundancy_k$: Redundancy cost for manpower type $k$.
    \item $num\_overman$: Maximum number of overmanned workers over the entire company.
    \item $costoverman_k$: Cost for each overmanned employee of type $k$ per year.
    \item $num\_shortwork$: Maximum number of short-time workers per manpower category.
    \item $costshort_k$: Cost for each short-time worker of type $k$ per year.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $recruit_{k,i}$: Number of manpower type $k$ recruited in year $i$.
    \item $overmanning_{k,i}$: Number of overmanning manpower type $k$ in year $i$.

    \item $employed_{k,i}$: Total number of employed manpower type $k$ in year $i$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total cost:

\[
\min \sum_{i=1}^{I} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \left( costredundancy_k \cdot redundancy_{k,i} + costoverman_k \cdot overmanning_{k,i} + costshort_k \cdot short_{k,i} \right)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{align}
& employed_{k,1} = strength_k - moreonewaste_k \cdot strength_k + recruit_{k,1}, & \forall k \\
& employed_{k,i} = employed_{k,i-1} - (lessonewaste_k \cdot recruit_{k,i-1} + moreonewaste_k \cdot (employed_{k,i-1} - recruit_{k,i-1})) + recruit_{k,i}, & \forall k, \forall i > 1 \\
& employed_{k,i} = requirement_{k,i} + overmanning_{k,i} + 0.5 \cdot short_{k,i}, & \forall k, \forall i \\
& recruit_{k,i} \leq recruit_k, & \forall k, \forall i \\

& redundancy_{k,i} = employed_{k,i} - (requirement_{k,i} + overmanning_{k,i} + 0.5 \cdot short_{k,i}), & \forall k, \forall i \\
\end{align}

\subsection*{Non-negativity}
\[
recruit_{k,i}, \overmanning_{k,i}, short_{k,i}, redundancy_{k,i} \geq 0, \quad \forall k, \forall i
\]

This model captures the balance between current manpower, recruitment, wastage, and staffing requirements while minimizing costs associated with recruitment, overmanning, and short-time working. Ensure all constraints are accurately interpreted and tailored to the specific data provided.
