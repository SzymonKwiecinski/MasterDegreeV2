PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

    "v_0": v_0,

}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is max_t |a_t|. 

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To formulate the given problem as a linear programming (LP) model, we need to define the objective function and constraints based on the problem description.

Objective: Minimize the maximum thrust required, which is \( \max_t |a_t| \).

Constraints:

1. Position update constraint:
   \[
   x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]

2. Velocity update constraint:
   \[
   v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]

3. Initial conditions:
   \[
   x_0 = \text{given}
   \]
   \[
   v_0 = \text{given}
   \]

4. Final conditions:
   \[
   x_T = \text{given}
   \]
   \[
   v_T = \text{given}
   \]

5. Absolute value constraint for acceleration (to linearize the problem, we introduce auxiliary variables):
   \[
   a_t^+ \geq a_t
   \]
   \[
   a_t^- \geq -a_t
   \]
   \[
   |a_t| = a_t^+ + a_t^-
   \]

6. The goal is to minimize the maximum of these absolute values over all time steps:
   \[
   \min z
   \]
   subject to:
   \[
   z \geq a_t^+ + a_t^- \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]

Let's put this into a \(\LaTeX\) format for the LP model:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Rocket LP Model}

\subsection*{Objective}
Minimize the maximum thrust:
\[
\min z
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{align}
x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t && \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t && \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
x_0 &= x_0 \\
v_0 &= v_0 \\
x_T &= x_T \\
v_T &= v_T \\
a_t^+ &\geq a_t \quad && \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
a_t^- &\geq -a_t \quad && \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
z &\geq a_t^+ + a_t^- && \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
\end{align}

\subsection*{Fuel Consumption}
The total fuel consumption is given by:
\[
\text{fuel\_spend} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} (a_t^+ + a_t^-)
\]

\end{document}
```

The above \(\LaTeX\) code sets out the constraints and objective for the linear programming problem, intended to minimize the maximum absolute acceleration while meeting initial and final position and velocity requirements.
