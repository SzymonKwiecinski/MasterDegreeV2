\section*{Mathematical Model}

\subsection*{Sets and Indices}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N$: Set of neighborhoods, indexed by $n$.
    \item $S$: Set of schools, indexed by $s$.
    \item $G$: Set of grades, indexed by $g$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $capacity_{s,g}$: Capacity of school $s$ for grade $g$.
    \item $population_{n,g}$: Student population of grade $g$ in neighborhood $n$.
    \item $d_{n,s}$: Distance from neighborhood $n$ to school $s$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{n,s,g}$: Number of students of grade $g$ from neighborhood $n$ assigned to school $s$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total distance traveled by all students:
\[
\min \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{s=1}^{S} \sum_{g=1}^{G} d_{n,s} \cdot x_{n,s,g}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Capacity Constraints:} Ensure that the number of students assigned to a school does not exceed its capacity for each grade.
    \[
    \sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n,s,g} \leq capacity_{s,g}, \quad \forall s \in S, \forall g \in G
    \]
    \item \textbf{Population Constraints:} Ensure that all students are assigned to a school.
    \[
    \sum_{s=1}^{S} x_{n,s,g} = population_{n,g}, \quad \forall n \in N, \forall g \in G
    \]
    \item \textbf{Non-negativity Constraints:} The number of students assigned must be non-negative.
    \[
    x_{n,s,g} \geq 0, \quad \forall n \in N, \forall s \in S, \forall g \in G
    \]
\end{itemize}
