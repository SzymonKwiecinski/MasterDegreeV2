PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A small computer manufacturing company forecasts the demand over the next \var{n}-th month to be \var{demand_{n}}.
- These demands must be satisfied and can not be shorted.
- In any month it can produce at most \var{max_regular_amount} units, using regular production, at a cost of \var{cost_regular} dollars per unit. 
- By using overtime, it can produce additional units at \var{cost_overtime} dollars per unit. 
- The firm can store units from month to month at a cost of \var{store_cost} dollars per unit per month. 

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"demand": [demand_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"max_regular_amount": max_regular_amount,
	"cost_regular": cost_regular,
	"cost_overtime": cost_overtime,
	"store_cost": store_cost
}


OBJECTIVE: Formulate the problem of determining the production schedule that minimizes the cost.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{reg_quant} represents the quantity of products produced using regular production in each future month
- \var{over_quant} represents the quantity of products produced using overtime production in each future month

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"reg_quant": [reg_quant_{n} for n in 1,...,N]
	"over_quant": [over_quant_{n} for n in 1,...,N]
}

To formulate the problem in a mathematical model, let's define the following decision variables:

- \( x_n \): the number of units produced using regular production in the \( n \)-th month.
- \( y_n \): the number of units produced using overtime production in the \( n \)-th month.
- \( s_n \): the number of units stored at the end of the \( n \)-th month.

The objective is to minimize the total cost, which includes the regular production cost, overtime production cost, and storage cost over all months. We can represent this as a linear programming problem in the following way:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total cost:
\[
\min \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( \text{cost\_regular} \cdot x_n + \text{cost\_overtime} \cdot y_n + \text{store\_cost} \cdot s_n \right)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{align*}
1. & \quad x_n + y_n + s_{n-1} = \text{demand}_{n} + s_n, \quad \forall n = 1, 2, \ldots, N\\
2. & \quad x_n \leq \text{max\_regular\_amount}, \quad \forall n = 1, 2, \ldots, N\\
3. & \quad x_n \geq 0, \quad y_n \geq 0, \quad s_n \geq 0, \quad \forall n = 1, 2, \ldots, N\\
4. & \quad s_0 = 0
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{align*}
x_n & : \text{Quantity produced using regular production in month } n\\
y_n & : \text{Quantity produced using overtime production in month } n\\
s_n & : \text{Units stored at the end of month } n
\end{align*}

\end{document}
```

In this model:
- The objective function minimizes the sum of the regular production costs, overtime production costs, and storage costs for each month.
- The first constraint ensures that the demand for each month is satisfied by the sum of regular production, overtime production, and any available stored units from the previous month.
- The second constraint ensures that the production using regular production does not exceed the maximum allowed (i.e., \( \text{max\_regular\_amount} \)).
- The non-negativity constraints ensure that the amounts produced and stored are non-negative.
- The initial storage is assumed to be zero (\( s_0 = 0 \)). 

This linear programming model allows you to calculate \(\text{reg\_quant}\) and \(\text{over\_quant}\) for each month \(n\), which correspond to \(x_n\) and \(y_n\), respectively.
