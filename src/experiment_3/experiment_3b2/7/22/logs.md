PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements in future years. 
- Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. 
- In addition to this, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, which will reduce the need for workers in all categories.
- The estimated manpower requirements for manpower \var{k} in year \var{i} is \var{requirement_{k, i}}.
- The current number of manpower \var{k} is \var{strength_{k}}.
- The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to recruitment, retraining, redundancy and short-time working in the next years.
- There is a natural wastage of labour. 
- A fairly large number of workers leave during their first year. After this, the rate of leaving is much smaller. 
- Taking this into account, the wastage rates of manpower \var{k} with less than one year's service is \var{lessonewaste_{k}}.
- The wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with more than one year's service is \var{moreonewaste_{k}}.
- There has been no recent recruitment and all the workers in the current labour force have been employed for more than one year.
- It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. 
- In any one year, the maximum number that can be recruited in manpower \var{k} is \var{recruit_{k}}.
- The redundancy payment to manpower \var{k} is \var{costredundancy_{k}}.
- It is possible to employ up to \var{num_overman} more workers over the whole company than are needed, but the extra costs per employee per year is \var{costoverman_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- Up to \var{num_shortwork} workers in each category of skill can be put on short-time working. 
- The cost of this (per employee per year) is \var{costshort_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of half a full-time employee.

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To create a Linear Programming (LP) model for this problem, we need to define decision variables, constraints, and the objective function that the company aims to minimize, which in this case is minimizing redundancy while satisfying manpower requirements.

Let's break down the problem and formulate it in LaTeX:

######### Decision Variables
- \( \text{recruit}_{k,i} \): Number of recruits for manpower \( k \) in year \( i \).
- \( \text{overmanning}_{k,i} \): Number of overmanned employees in manpower \( k \) in year \( i \).
- \( \text{short}_{k,i} \): Number of short-time employees for manpower \( k \) in year \( i \).
- \( \text{redundancy}_{k,i} \): Number of redundancies for manpower \( k \) in year \( i \).

######### Objective Function
Minimize total redundancy cost over all categories and years.

######### Constraints
1. **Manpower Balance Equation**: The number of manpower at the end of each year must satisfy the requirement for the next year, considering recruits, redundancy, wastage, overmanning, and short-time working.

2. **Recruitment Limitations**: 
   \[ \text{recruit}_{k,i} \leq \text{recruit}_{k} \]

3. **Redundancy and Overmanning Constraints**:
   \[ \text{overmanning}_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_overman} \]

4. **Short-time Working Constraints**:
   \[ \text{short}_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_shortwork} \]

5. **Initial Conditions**: All workers initially have more than one year's service.

6. **Non-negativity**: 
   All decision variables \((\text{recruit}_{k,i}, \text{overmanning}_{k,i}, \text{short}_{k,i}, \text{redundancy}_{k,i})\) must be greater than or equal to zero.

Here's the LP model in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

\subsection*{Indices}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( k \): Index for manpower category, \( k = 1, \ldots, K \).
    \item \( i \): Index for years, \( i = 1, \ldots, I \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{align*}
    \text{recruit}_{k,i} & : \text{Number of recruits for manpower \( k \) in year \( i \)} \\
    \text{overmanning}_{k,i} & : \text{Number of overmanned employees for manpower \( k \) in year \( i \)} \\
    \text{short}_{k,i} & : \text{Number of short-time employees for manpower \( k \) in year \( i \)} \\
    \text{redundancy}_{k,i} & : \text{Number of redundancies for manpower \( k \) in year \( i \)}
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total redundancy cost:
\[
\min \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{i=1}^{I} \text{redundancy}_{k,i} \times \text{costredundancy}_{k}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{align*}
    & \text{Manpower Balance:} \\
    & \quad \text{strength}_{k,i-1} + \text{recruit}_{k,i} - \text{redundancy}_{k,i} \times(1 - \text{moreonewaste}_{k}) + \text{overmanning}_{k,i} + 0.5 \times \text{short}_{k,i} \\
    & \quad \geq \text{requirement}_{k,i} \\
    & \text{Recruitment Limit:} \\
    & \quad \text{recruit}_{k,i} \leq \text{recruit}_{k} \\
    & \text{Overmanning Limit:} \\
    & \quad \text{overmanning}_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_overman} \\
    & \text{Short-time Working Limit:} \\
    & \quad \text{short}_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_shortwork} \\
    & \text{Non-negativity:} \\
    & \quad \text{recruit}_{k,i}, \text{overmanning}_{k,i}, \text{short}_{k,i}, \text{redundancy}_{k,i} \geq 0
\end{align*}

\end{document}
```

This mathematical model will help the company decide how to allocate manpower resources efficiently while minimizing redundancy costs over the planned years. The constraints ensure that the manpower needs are met, considering recruitment, redundancy, and the natural wastage of workers, alongside the options for overmanning and short-time working.
