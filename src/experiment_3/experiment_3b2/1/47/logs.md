PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- The town has \var{S} different shifts for the police officers during the day.
- During each shift \var{s}, the town requires \var{officers_needed_{s}} police officers on duty.
- Each police officer works for two consecutive shifts.
- The cost for the town when starting a shift at \var{s} is \var{shift_cost_{s}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "officers_needed": [officers_needed_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "shift_costs": [shift_cost_{s} for s in 1, ..., S]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many officers should the town assign to each shift in order to minimize the total cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- The number of officers assigned to each shift \var{officers_assigned_{s}}.
- \var{total_cost} indicates the total cost for the town.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "officers_assigned": [officers_assigned_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we will create a linear programming model. The goal is to determine the number of police officers to assign to each shift in order to minimize the total cost while meeting the requirements for each shift.

######### Decision Variables:
- Let \( x_s \) be the number of officers assigned to start working at shift \( s \).

######### Objective Function:
- Minimize the total cost:
  \[
  \text{minimize} \quad \sum_{s=1}^{S} \text{shift\_cost}_s \times x_s
  \]

######### Constraints:
- We need at least \(\text{officers\_needed}_s\) for each shift \( s \).
- Since each officer works in two consecutive shifts, the officers available at shift \( s \) are those who start at \( s \) and those who started at the previous shift \( (s-1) \).

Formally, for each shift \( s \):
1. \( x_s + x_{s-1} \geq \text{officers\_needed}_s \)
   - Note: For the first shift when \( s = 1 \), assume \( x_0 = x_S \) due to wrap-around of shifts.

Now, let's represent these in LaTeX for a Linear Programming model.

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\textbf{Linear Programming Model:}

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \text{Minimize} \quad && \sum_{s=1}^{S} \text{shift\_cost}_s \cdot x_s \\
& \text{subject to} \quad && x_s + x_{s-1} \geq \text{officers\_needed}_s, \quad s = 1, 2, \ldots, S \\
& && x_s \geq 0 \quad \text{and integer for all } s
\end{aligned}
\]

\end{document}
```

######### Notes:
- The constraint \( x_s + x_{s-1} \geq \text{officers\_needed}_s \) ensures that we meet the requirement for each shift.
- The variable \( x_s \) is assumed to be non-negative and integer, as partial officers cannot be assigned.
- If the shifts are cyclic (i.e., the last shift is followed by the first shift), ensure to include the cyclic constraint \( x_1 + x_S \geq \text{officers\_needed}_1 \).
