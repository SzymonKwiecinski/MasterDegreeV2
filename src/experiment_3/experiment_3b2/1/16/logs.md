PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- A manager of an oil refinery has \var{allocated_i} million barrels of crude oil type \var{i} allocated for production during the coming month. 
- These resources can be used to make \var{P} different products. product \var{p} sells for $ \var{price_p} per barrel.
- There are \var{L} production processes. Process \var{l} uses \var{input_l_i} barrels of each crude \var{i}, and produces \var{output_l_p} barrels of each product \var{p}. 
- Process \var{l} has a cost of \var{cost_l} per barrel of product produced.
- All \var{input_l_i} quantities and \var{output_l_p} quanitites are in barrels. 
- There are no separate cost items for the cost of the crudes, as they have already been allocated.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "allocated": [allocated_i for i in 1, ..., O],
    "price": [price_p for p in 1, ..., P],
    "input": [[input_l_i for i in 1, ..., O] for l in 1, ..., L],
    "output": [[output_l_p for p in 1, ..., P] for l in 1, ..., L],
    "cost": [cost_l for l in 1, ..., L]
}

OBJECTIVE: We want to know how many times should we execute each process to maximize the revenue for the next month (you can assume that the number of times that each process is executed is a floating point number)

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{revenue} is the total revenue for the month.
- \var{execute_l} is the number of times that process \var{l} should be executed.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "revenue": revenue,
    "execute": [execute_l for l in 1, ..., L]
}

To solve this linear programming problem, we need to define the decision variables, the objective function, and the constraints in a linear programming model.

**Decision Variables:**

Let \( x_l \) be the number of times process \( l \) is executed, for \( l = 1, 2, \ldots, L \).

**Objective Function:**

The objective is to maximize the total revenue, which is the revenue from selling the products minus the cost of the processes. The revenue from each product \( p \) is the sum of the products of the output and the price. Hence, the objective function would be:

\[
\text{Maximize } \sum_{p=1}^{P} \left( \left( \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{output}_{l,p} \cdot x_l \right) \cdot \text{price}_p \right) - \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( \text{cost}_l \cdot \left( \sum_{p=1}^{P} \text{output}_{l,p} \cdot x_l \right) \right)
\]

**Constraints:**

1. Crude oil constraints: The usage of each type of crude oil should not exceed the allocated amount:
   \[
   \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{input}_{l,i} \cdot x_l \leq \text{allocated}_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, O
   \]

2. Non-negativity constraints: The number of times each process is executed must be non-negative:
   \[
   x_l \geq 0, \quad \forall l = 1, \ldots, L
   \]

Based on these parameters, the linear programming model can be constructed in LaTeX as follows:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Maximizing Revenue at an Oil Refinery}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let \( x_l \) be the number of times process \( l \) is executed, for \( l = 1, 2, \ldots, L \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Maximize the total revenue:

\[
\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{p=1}^{P} \left( \left( \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{output}_{l,p} \cdot x_l \right) \cdot \text{price}_p \right) - \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( \text{cost}_l \cdot \left( \sum_{p=1}^{P} \text{output}_{l,p} \cdot x_l \right) \right)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. Crude oil constraints: For each crude oil type \( i \):

\[
\sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{input}_{l,i} \cdot x_l \leq \text{allocated}_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, O
\]

2. Non-negativity constraints:

\[
x_l \geq 0, \quad \forall l = 1, \ldots, L
\]

\end{document}
```

This model specifies the problem of maximizing revenue from an oil refinery's production planning by optimizing the usage of available crude oils in various production processes.
