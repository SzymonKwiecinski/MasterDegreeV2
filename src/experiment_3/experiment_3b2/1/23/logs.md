PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements in future years. 
- Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. 
- In addition to this, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, which will reduce the need for workers in all categories.
- The estimated manpower requirements for manpower \var{k} in year \var{i} is \var{requirement_{k, i}}.
- The current strength of manpower \var{k} is \var{strength_{k}}.
- The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to recruitment, retraining, redundancy and short-time working in the next years.
- There is a natural wastage of labour. 
- A fairly large number of workers leave during their first year. After this, the rate is much smaller. 
- Taking this into account, the wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with less than one year's service is \var{lessonewaste_{k}}.
- The wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with more than one year's service is \var{moreonewaste_{k}}.
- There has been no recent recruitment and all workers in the current labour force have been employed for more than one year.
- It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. 
- In any one year, the numbers that can be recruited in manpower \var{k} is \var{recruit_{k}}.
- The redundancy payment to manpower \var{k} is \var{costredundancy_{k}}.
- It is possible to employ up to \var{num_overman} more workers over the whole company than are needed, but the extra costs per employee per year is \var{costoverman_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- Up to \var{num_shortwork} workers in each category of skill can be put on short-time working. 
- The cost of this (per employee per year) is \var{costshort_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of half a full-time employee.

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem as a Linear Programming (LP) problem, we need to define the decision variables, constraints, and objective function in mathematical terms. Here's a possible formulation in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

Let us define the decision variables for this problem:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{recruit}_{k,i} \): Number of manpower type \( k \) recruited in year \( i \).
    \item \( \text{redundant}_{k,i} \): Number of manpower type \( k \) made redundant in year \( i \).
    \item \( \text{overmanning}_{k,i} \): Number of excess manpower type \( k \) employed in year \( i \).
    \item \( \text{short}_{k,i} \): Number of manpower type \( k \) on short-time working in year \( i \).
\end{itemize}

The objective is to minimize the total cost, given by:

\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{i=1}^{I} \left( \text{costredundancy}_k \cdot \text{redundant}_{k,i} + \text{costoverman}_k \cdot \text{overmanning}_{k,i} + \text{costshort}_k \cdot \text{short}_{k,i} \right)
\]

Subject to the constraints:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Manpower balance constraint:}
    \[
    \text{strength}_{k, 1} = \text{strength}_k - \text{moreonewaste}_k \cdot \text{strength}_k + \text{recruit}_{k, 1} - \text{redundant}_{k,1}
    \]
    
    For \( i > 1 \):
    \[
    \text{strength}_{k, i} = (1 - \text{lessonewaste}_k) \cdot \text{recruit}_{k, i-1} + (1 - \text{moreonewaste}_k) \cdot (\text{strength}_{k,i-1} + \text{overmanning}_{k,i-1}) - \text{redundant}_{k,i}
    \]

    \item \textbf{Demand constraint:}
    \[
    \text{strength}_{k,i} + \text{overmanning}_{k,i} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{short}_{k,i} \geq \text{requirement}_{k,i}
    \]

    \item \textbf{Recruitment constraints:}
    \[
    \text{recruit}_{k,i} \leq \text{recruit}_k
    \]

    \item \textbf{Overmanning constraints:}
    \[
    \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{overmanning}_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_overman}
    \]

    \item \textbf{Short-time working constraints:}
    \[
    \text{short}_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_shortwork}
    \]

    \item \textbf{Non-negativity constraints:}
    \[
    \text{recruit}_{k,i}, \text{redundant}_{k,i}, \text{overmanning}_{k,i}, \text{short}_{k,i} \geq 0
    \]
\end{itemize}

This LP model will help the company decide the optimal number of recruitments, redundancies, overmanning, and short-time working employees to minimize the total cost while meeting manpower requirements.

\end{document}
```

This model captures the essence of the problem, defining the key decision variables and constraints that reflect the company's policy considerations. The objective function seeks to minimize the total cost associated with redundancy payments, overmanning, and short-time working costs.

    \item \( \text{redundant}_{k,i} \): Number of manpower type \( k \) made redundant in year \( i \).

Subject to the constraints:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Manpower balance constraint:}
    \[
    \text{strength}_{k, 1} = \text{strength}_k - \text{moreonewaste}_k \cdot \text{strength}_k + \text{recruit}_{k, 1} - \text{redundant}_{k,1}
    \]
    
    For \( i > 1 \):
    \[
    \text{strength}_{k, i} = (1 - \text{lessonewaste}_k) \cdot \text{recruit}_{k, i-1} + (1 - \text{moreonewaste}_k) \cdot (\text{strength}_{k,i-1} + \text{overmanning}_{k,i-1}) - \text{redundant}_{k,i}
    \]

    \item \textbf{Demand constraint:}
    \[
    \text{strength}_{k,i} + \text{overmanning}_{k,i} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{short}_{k,i} \geq \text{requirement}_{k,i}
    \]

    \item \textbf{Recruitment constraints:}
    \[
    \text{recruit}_{k,i} \leq \text{recruit}_k
    \]

    \item \textbf{Overmanning constraints:}
    \[
    \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{overmanning}_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_overman}
    \]

    \item \textbf{Short-time working constraints:}
    \[
    \text{short}_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_shortwork}
    \]

    \item \textbf{Non-negativity constraints:}
    \[
    \text{recruit}_{k,i}, \text{redundant}_{k,i}, \text{overmanning}_{k,i}, \text{short}_{k,i} \geq 0
    \]
\end{itemize}

This LP model will help the company decide the optimal number of recruitments, redundancies, overmanning, and short-time working employees to minimize the total cost while meeting manpower requirements.
