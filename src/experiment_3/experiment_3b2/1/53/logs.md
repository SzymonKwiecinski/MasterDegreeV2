PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
        for id in 1, ..., m
    ],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

To solve this linear programming problem, we will create a mathematical model in which we minimize the transportation cost while fulfilling the demand at each destination and not exceeding the supply at each terminal. The given problem can be formulated in a standard linear programming form.

Let's define the decision variables, objective function, and constraints in LATEX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Model}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}

\[
x_{i,j} = \text{Amount of soybeans transported from node } i \text{ to node } j
\]

\textbf{Objective Function:}

Minimize the total cost of transportation:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j}
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}

1. Supply constraints: The total amount shipped from each terminal \(k\) should not exceed the supply at that terminal.

\[
\sum_{j : (k,j) \in A} x_{k,j} \leq \text{supply}_k, \quad \forall k
\]

2. Demand constraints: The total amount received at each destination \(l\) should meet its demand.

\[
\sum_{i : (i,l) \in A} x_{i,l} \geq \text{demand}_l, \quad \forall l
\]

3. Flow balance for intermediate nodes (ports): The total inflow should equal the total outflow.

\[
\sum_{i : (i,p) \in A} x_{i,p} = \sum_{j : (p,j) \in A} x_{p,j}, \quad \forall \text{port } p
\]

4. Non-negativity constraints: All transported amounts should be non-negative.

\[
x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall (i,j) \in A
\]

\end{document}
```

This linear programming model will help compute the optimal distribution of soybeans from the terminal to the destination that minimizes transportation costs while satisfying all supply and demand constraints.
