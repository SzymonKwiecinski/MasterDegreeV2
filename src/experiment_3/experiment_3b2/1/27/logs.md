<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"benefit": [[benefit_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...,K],
	"communication": [[communication_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
	"cost": [[cost_{l, m} for m in 1,...,L] for l in 1,...,L],
}


OBJECTIVE: Where should each department be located so as to minimize overall yearly cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{islocated_{k, l}} represents whether department \var{k} is relocated at city \var{l}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "islocated": [[islocated_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...K],
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem, we need to determine the optimal relocation of departments to minimize the overall yearly cost, taking into account the benefits of relocation and the costs of communication.

The mathematical model in LaTeX format is as follows:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Model}

\textbf{Sets:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $K$: Set of departments, indexed by $k$.
    \item $L$: Set of possible locations (cities), indexed by $l$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $benefit_{k,l}$: Benefit for department $k$ from relocation at city $l$ (in thousands of pounds).
    \item $communication_{k,j}$: Quantity of communication between department $k$ and department $j$.
    \item $cost_{l,m}$: Unit cost of communication between city $l$ and city $m$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $islocated_{k,l} \in \{0, 1\}$: Binary variable indicating whether department $k$ is relocated at city $l$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective Function:}
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( -benefit_{k,l} \cdot islocated_{k,l} \right) + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{j=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{m=1}^{L} \left( communication_{k,j} \cdot cost_{l,m} \cdot islocated_{k,l} \cdot islocated_{j,m} \right)
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}
\begin{align}
    & \sum_{l=1}^{L} islocated_{k,l} = 1 \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K \\ 
    & \sum_{k=1}^{K} islocated_{k,l} \leq 3 \quad \forall l = 1, \ldots, L \\
    & islocated_{k,l} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K, \, l = 1, \ldots, L 
\end{align}

\textbf{Explanation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Equation (1) ensures that each department is located in exactly one city.
    \item Equation (2) ensures that no city hosts more than three departments.
    \item The objective function includes the benefits of relocation (which are subtracted to reflect cost minimization) and the network communication costs.
\end{itemize}
