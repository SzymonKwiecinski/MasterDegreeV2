\section*{Mathematical Model}

\textbf{Sets:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $K$: Set of departments, indexed by $k$.
    \item $L$: Set of possible locations (cities), indexed by $l$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $benefit_{k,l}$: Benefit for department $k$ from relocation at city $l$ (in thousands of pounds).
    \item $communication_{k,j}$: Quantity of communication between department $k$ and department $j$.
    \item $cost_{l,m}$: Unit cost of communication between city $l$ and city $m$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $islocated_{k,l} \in \{0, 1\}$: Binary variable indicating whether department $k$ is relocated at city $l$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective Function:}
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( -benefit_{k,l} \cdot islocated_{k,l} \right) + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{j=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{m=1}^{L} \left( communication_{k,j} \cdot cost_{l,m} \cdot islocated_{k,l} \cdot islocated_{j,m} \right)
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}
\begin{align}
    & \sum_{l=1}^{L} islocated_{k,l} = 1 \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K \\ 
    & \sum_{k=1}^{K} islocated_{k,l} \leq 3 \quad \forall l = 1, \ldots, L \\
    & islocated_{k,l} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K, \, l = 1, \ldots, L 
\end{align}

\textbf{Explanation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Equation (1) ensures that each department is located in exactly one city.
    \item Equation (2) ensures that no city hosts more than three departments.
    \item The objective function includes the benefits of relocation (which are subtracted to reflect cost minimization) and the network communication costs.
\end{itemize}
