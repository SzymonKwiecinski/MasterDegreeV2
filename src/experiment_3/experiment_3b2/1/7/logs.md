PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

\section*{Mathematical Model for Rocket Trajectory Optimization}

\subsection*{Given Data and Problem Description}

We consider a rocket traveling along a straight path with the following parameters:
- Initial position: \( x_0 \)
- Initial velocity: \( v_0 \)
- Target position: \( x_T \)
- Target velocity: \( v_T \)
- Time horizon: \( T \)

The state of the rocket at time \( t \) is represented by:
- Position: \( x_t \)
- Velocity: \( v_t \)
- Acceleration: \( a_t \)

The relationships between these variables over discrete time increments are given by:
\begin{align*}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t
\end{align*}

The acceleration \( a_t \) is controlled by the rocket's thrust, and we aim to minimize the maximum thrust required over the course of the flight, denoted as \( \max_t |a_t| \).

\subsection*{Objective}

Minimize the maximum thrust:

\[
\min \max_t |a_t|, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

The constraints for the rocket's trajectory are:
1. Initial and target conditions for position and velocity:
   \begin{align*}
       x_0 &= \text{given} \\
       v_0 &= \text{given} \\
       x_T &= \text{given target position} \\
       v_T &= \text{given target velocity}
   \end{align*}

2. Dynamics of the motion for \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \):
   \begin{align*}
       x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \\
       v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t
   \end{align*}

3. Fuel consumption is proportional to the absolute value of acceleration \( |a_t| \).

\subsection*{Decision Variables}

- \( x_t \): Position of the rocket at time \( t \)
- \( v_t \): Velocity of the rocket at time \( t \)
- \( a_t \): Acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \)
- \( |a_t| \leq M \) with \( M = \max_t |a_t| \)

\subsection*{Output Information}

The solution to the problem will provide:
- A list of the positions \( x_t \) for \( t = 1, \ldots, T \)
- A list of the velocities \( v_t \) for \( t = 1, \ldots, T \)
- A list of the accelerations \( a_t \) for \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \)
- The total fuel spent, computed as:
  \[
  \text{fuel\_spend} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
  \]
