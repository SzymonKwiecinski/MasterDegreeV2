<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- An Italian transport company must send empty containers from its depots to ports. 
- The number of containers available in the depot \var{i} is denoted with \var{numdepot_i}. 
- Container requirement in port \var{j} is \var{numport_{j}}. 
- Transport of containers is by barges. 
- Each barge can only contain two containers and the cost of transport (per barge) is proportional to the distance traveled (price is \var{price} Euros/km).
- The distances between depot \var{i} and port \var{j} is \var{distance_{i, j}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"numdepot": [numdepot_{i} for i in 1,...,I],
	"numport": [numport_{j} for j in 1,...,J],
	"price": price,
	"distance": [[distance_{i, j} for i in 1,...I] for j in 1,...,J]
}


OBJECTIVE: Minimize the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT INFO:

\var{number} represents the number of containers sent from each depot to port

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"number": [[number_{i, j} for i in 1,...,I] for j in 1,...,J]
}

To solve this Linear Programming problem, we will define the decision variables, objective function, and constraints.

**Decision Variables:**

Let \( x_{i,j} \) be the number of containers sent from depot \( i \) to port \( j \).

**Objective Function:**

The goal is to minimize the total transportation cost, which can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{I} \sum_{j=1}^{J} \left( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{price} \times \text{distance}_{i,j} \times x_{i,j} \right)
\]

Note: Each barge contains two containers, thus the number of barges needed is \( \frac{x_{i,j}}{2} \), and we multiply by the price per km to get the cost.

**Constraints:**

1. Supply Constraints: The total number of containers sent from a depot cannot exceed the number available at that depot.

\[
\sum_{j=1}^{J} x_{i,j} \leq \text{numdepot}_i \quad \forall i
\]

2. Demand Constraints: The total number of containers received at a port must meet the demand at that port.

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{I} x_{i,j} = \text{numport}_j \quad \forall j
\]

3. Non-Negativity:

\[
x_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \forall i, j
\]

Given these definitions, the complete LP problem in LaTeX format is as follows:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Objective:}

Minimize:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{I} \sum_{j=1}^{J} \left( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{price} \times \text{distance}_{i,j} \times x_{i,j} \right)
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}

1. Supply Constraints:
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{J} x_{i,j} \leq \text{numdepot}_i \quad \forall i
\]

2. Demand Constraints:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{I} x_{i,j} = \text{numport}_j \quad \forall j
\]

3. Non-Negativity Constraints:
\[
x_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \forall i, j
\]

\end{document}
``` 

This LP model will help determine the optimal number of containers to transport from each depot to each port at minimal cost.
