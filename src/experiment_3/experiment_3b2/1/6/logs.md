PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT:

    "x_0": x_0,
    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,

}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the total fuel \sum_{t=0}^{\var{T}-1} |\var{a_t}| spent subject to the preceding constraints.

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "fuel_spend" contains the total fuel spent by the rocket

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "v": [v_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "a": [a_i for i in 1, ..., T],

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem as a linear programming (LP) problem, we seek to minimize the absolute value of acceleration at each time step, which represents the fuel consumed. The LP formulation is as follows:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Objective:} Minimize the total fuel consumption:

\[
\min \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}

1. Discretized motion equations:
   \[
   x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]
   \[
   v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]

2. Initial conditions:
   \[
   x_0 = \text{given}
   \]
   \[
   v_0 = \text{given}
   \]

3. Target conditions:
   \[
   x_T = \text{given}
   \]
   \[
   v_T = \text{given}
   \]

4. Absolute value of acceleration:
   To handle the absolute value, introduce auxiliary variables \( u_t \) such that:
   \[
   -u_t \leq a_t \leq u_t \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]
   which ensures \( |a_t| \leq u_t \).

5. Rewrite the objective function using auxiliary variables:
   \[
   \min \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} u_t
   \]

\textbf{Decision Variables:} 
- \( x_t \) for position at each time step \( t \),
- \( v_t \) for velocity at each time step \( t \),
- \( a_t \) for acceleration at each time step \( t \),
- \( u_t \) for auxiliary variables representing \( |a_t| \).

\end{document}
```

This LP formulation allows us to compute the optimal trajectory, velocities, accelerations, and fuel spent over the time horizon by solving the linear program. The constraints ensure the motion follows the physical laws, initial and terminal conditions match the requirements, and the objective function is structured to minimize the total fuel consumption.
