PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a school district with \var{N} neighborhoods, \var{S} schools, and \var{G} grades at each school.
- Each school \var{s} has a capacity of \var{capacity_{s,g}} for grade \var{g}. 
- In each neighborhood \var{n}, the student population of grade \var{g} is \var{population_{n,g}}. 
- Finally, the distance of school \var{s} from neighborhood \var{n} is \var{d_{i,j}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "capacity": [[capacity_{s,g} for g in 1, ..., G] for s in 1, ..., S],
    "population": [[population_{n,g} for g in 1, ..., G] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "distance": [[d_{n,s} for s in 1, ..., S] for n in 1, ..., N]
}

OBJECTIVE: We want to assign all students to schools, while minimizing the total distance traveled by all students. We may ignore the fact that numbers of students must be integers.

OUTPUT INFO:
- the output should show optimal \var{x_{n,s,g}} for all \var{n}, \var{s}, \var{g} (i.e., the number of students of grade \var{g} in neighborhood \var{n} assigned to school \var{s}).
- the output should also include \var{total_distance}, the total distance traveled by all students.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "assignment": [[[x_{n,s,g} for g in 1, ..., G] for s in 1, ..., S] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "total_distance": total_distance
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this linear programming problem, we need to set up a mathematical model that assigns students to schools such that the total distance traveled is minimized, while respecting the capacity constraints of each school for each grade and ensuring that all students are assigned.

Let's define the variables and formulate the linear programming model.

######### Decision Variables:
- \( x_{n,s,g} \): the number of students of grade \( g \) from neighborhood \( n \) assigned to school \( s \).

######### Objective Function:
We aim to minimize the total distance traveled by all students:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{s=1}^{S} \sum_{g=1}^{G} d_{n,s} \times x_{n,s,g}
\]

######### Constraints:
1. **Capacity Constraints**: The number of students assigned to a school for a particular grade should not exceed its capacity.
   \[
   \sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n,s,g} \leq \text{capacity}_{s,g} \quad \forall s \in \{1, \ldots, S\}, \forall g \in \{1, \ldots, G\}
   \]

2. **Demand Constraints**: All students from each neighborhood and for each grade must be assigned to some school.
   \[
   \sum_{s=1}^{S} x_{n,s,g} = \text{population}_{n,g} \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}, \forall g \in \{1, \ldots, G\}
   \]

3. **Non-negativity Constraints**: The assignment must be non-negative.
   \[
   x_{n,s,g} \geq 0 \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}, \forall s \in \{1, \ldots, S\}, \forall g \in \{1, \ldots, G\}
   \]

Here is the LATEX representation of the above linear programming model:

```latex

\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Model}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{n,s,g}$: Number of students of grade $g$ from neighborhood $n$ assigned to school $s$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total distance traveled by all students:
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{s=1}^{S} \sum_{g=1}^{G} d_{n,s} \times x_{n,s,g}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. **Capacity Constraints**:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n,s,g} \leq \text{capacity}_{s,g} \quad \forall s \in \{1, \ldots, S\}, \forall g \in \{1, \ldots, G\}
\]

2. **Demand Constraints**:
\[
\sum_{s=1}^{S} x_{n,s,g} = \text{population}_{n,g} \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}, \forall g \in \{1, \ldots, G\}
\]

3. **Non-negativity Constraints**:
\[
x_{n,s,g} \geq 0 \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}, \forall s \in \{1, \ldots, S\}, \forall g \in \{1, \ldots, G\}
\]

\end{document}
```
This linear programming model can be solved using any LP solver to find the optimal assignment of students to schools that minimizes the total distance traveled while satisfying all constraints.

Here's the corrected Python code with the syntax errors fixed. The main issue was the constraint naming in the loop which resulted in overlapping constraint names. I modified the naming to include the specific indices used in each iteration.

```python
import pulp

#### Data in JSON format
data_json = '''{
    "S": 3,
    "G": 2,
    "N": 4,

    "Population": [[7, 19], [4, 12], [9, 2], [6, 8]],
    "Distance": [[5.2, 4.0, 3.1], [3.8, 5.5, 6.1], [4.2, 3.5, 5.0], [5.0, 4.1, 3.2]]
}'''

data = json.loads(data_json)

#### Extracting parameters from data
S = data['S']
G = data['G']
N = data['N']
capacity = data['Capacity']
population = data['Population']
distance = data['Distance']

#### Create the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("School_Assignment_Problem", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Decision Variables
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("x", ((n, s, g) for n in range(N) for s in range(S) for g in range(G)), lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')

#### Objective Function
problem += pulp.lpSum(distance[n][s] * x[n, s, g] for n in range(N) for s in range(S) for g in range(G)), "Total_Distance"

#### Capacity Constraints
for s in range(S):
    for g in range(G):
        problem += pulp.lpSum(x[n, s, g] for n in range(N)) <= capacity[s][g], f"Capacity_Constraint_s{s}_g{g}"

#### Demand Constraints
for n in range(N):
    for g in range(G):
        problem += pulp.lpSum(x[n, s, g] for s in range(S)) == population[n][g], f"Demand_Constraint_n{n}_g{g}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Print the objective value
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

######### Changes Made:
1. Changed the constraint names in the "Capacity Constraints" section from `f"Capacity_Constraint_s{S}_g{G}"` to `f"Capacity_Constraint_s{s}_g{g}"` to ensure unique names for each constraint based on their respective indices. 

This should resolve the overlapping constraint names issue.
