PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Suppose that there are \var{N} available currencies, and assume that one unit of currency \var{i} can be exchanged for \var{rate_{i,j}} units of currency \var{j} (Naturally, we assume that \var{rate_{i,j}} > 0).
- There are also certain regulations that impose a limit \var{limit_i} on the total amount of currency \var{i} that can be exchanged (whether to other currencies or from other currencies) on any given day.
- Suppose that we start the day with \var{start_i} units of currency \var{i}
- Provide a linear programming formulation of this problem. Assume that for any sequence \var{i_1}, â€¦ ,\var{i_k} of currencies, we have \var{rate_{i_1,i_2}}, \var{rate_{i_2,i_3}}, ..., \var{rate_{i_{k-1}, i_{k}}, \var{rate_{i_k, i_1}} <= 1, which means that wealth cannot be multiplied by going through a cycle of currencies.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "start": [start_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "limit": [limit_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "rate": [[rate_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., N] for i in 1, ..., N],
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to maximize the number of units of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day, through a sequence of currency transactions.

OUTPUT INFO: 

- The output json file contains a list of transactions, where each transaction is a json object with the following fields:
    - from: the currency that we are exchanging from
    - to: the currency that we are exchanging to
    - amount: the amount of currency that we are exchanging
- The output json file also contains the final amount of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day.

OUTPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": i,
            "to": j,
            "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
    ],
    "final_amount_of_currency_N": final_amount_of_currency_N

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To formulate this problem as a linear programming model, we want to maximize the final amount of currency \( N \) at the end of the day while adhering to the exchange rates, initial start amounts, and regulatory limits. We'll denote the decision variables as \( x_{i,j} \), representing the amount of currency \( i \) to be exchanged for currency \( j \).

Let's represent this in a formal linear programming model in LaTeX.

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Currency Exchange}

\textbf{Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( N \): Number of available currencies.
    \item \( \text{start}_i \): Initial amount of currency \( i \).
    \item \( \text{limit}_i \): Maximum amount of currency \( i \) that can be exchanged.
    \item \( \text{rate}_{i,j} \): Exchange rate from currency \( i \) to currency \( j \).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_{i,j} \geq 0 \): Amount of currency \( i \) to be exchanged for currency \( j \).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective:}
\[
\text{Maximize } \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} x_{i,N} \cdot \text{rate}_{i,N} + \text{start}_N - \sum_{j=1}^{N-1} x_{N,j}
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}
\begin{align*}
    & x_{i,j} \leq \text{limit}_i, & \forall i, j = 1, \ldots, N \text{ and } i \neq j \\
    & \sum_{j=1, j \neq i}^{N} x_{i,j} \leq \text{start}_i + \sum_{k=1, k \neq i}^{N} x_{k,i} \cdot \text{rate}_{k,i}, & \forall i = 1, \ldots, N \\
\end{align*}

\textbf{Explanation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The objective function maximizes the amount of currency \( N \) we end up with by considering the total incoming exchanged amount adjusted for the exchange rate, adding the starting currency \( N \), and subtracting the amount exchanged away from currency \( N \).
    \item The first set of constraints ensures that the transaction amount between any two currencies does not exceed the regulatory limits.
    \item The second set of constraints ensures that for any currency \( i \), the total exchanged amount does not exceed the initial amount plus any incoming exchanged currency adjusted by the respective exchange rate.
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

This formulation captures the constraints related to regulatory limits and ensures the objective of maximizing the amount of currency \( N \) at the end of the day. The linear programming model should be solved with a solver to obtain the optimal transactions.
