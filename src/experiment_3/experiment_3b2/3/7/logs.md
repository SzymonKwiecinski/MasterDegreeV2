PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

To address this problem through linear programming, we need to develop a mathematical model that minimizes the maximum thrust while ensuring that the rocket reaches the target position and speed in the given time frame. Let's establish the model in LaTeX format.

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

We are given the following data:
\begin{align*}
x_0 &= \text{initial position of the rocket}, \\
v_0 &= \text{initial velocity of the rocket}, \\
x_T &= \text{target position at time } T, \\
v_T &= \text{target velocity at time } T, \\
T &= \text{time horizon}.
\end{align*}

We aim to minimize the maximum thrust, denoted by $\max_t |a_t|$, subjected to the discrete-time rocket equations:
\begin{align}
x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1, \\
v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t, \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1,
\end{align}
with the initial conditions:
\begin{align}
x_0 &= x_0, \\
v_0 &= v_0,
\end{align}
and the final conditions:
\begin{align}
x_T &= x_T, \\
v_T &= v_T.
\end{align}

Additionally, let us introduce a variable $M$ to represent the maximum absolute acceleration. Our objective function becomes:
\[
\min M
\]

Subject to the constraints:
\begin{align}
-M &\leq a_t \leq M, \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1, \\
x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \\
v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t, \\
x_0 &= x_0, \quad v_0 = v_0, \\
x_T &= x_T, \quad v_T = v_T.
\end{align}

The fuel consumption is proportional to the absolute acceleration. Thus, the total fuel spent, $F$, can be calculated as:
\[
F = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

This completes the linear programming formulation of the rocket problem.

\end{document}
``` 

This linear programming model aims to minimize the maximum thrust required for the rocket to reach the desired position and velocity while ensuring that fuel consumption is accounted for by integrating the absolute value of the acceleration over time.
