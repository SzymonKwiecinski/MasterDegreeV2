PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- A hospital wants to make a weekly night shift (12pm-8am) schedule for its nurses. 
- The demand for nurses for the night shift on day \var{j} = 1,...,7 is an integer \var{d_j}. 
- Every nurse works \var{period} days in a row on the night shift, followed by (7 - \var{period}) days off.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "period": period,
    "demand": [d_j for j in 1, ...,7]
}

OBJECTIVE: The goal is to find the minimal number of nurses the hospital needs to hire. 

OUTPUT INFO: 

- for each day \var{j} = 1,...,7, \var{start_j} which shows the number of nurses that start their period on day \var{j}.
- the total number of nurses hired.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "start": [start_j for j in 1, ...,7],
    "total": total
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we need to create a mathematical model using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Let's define the mathematical model as follows:

**Decision Variables:**
- \( x_j \): Integer variable representing the number of nurses that start their period on day \( j \) for \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \).

**Parameters:**
- \( d_j \): Demand for nurses for the night shift on day \( j \) for \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \).
- \( \text{period} \): Length of the period of consecutive working days for the nurses.

**Objective Function:**
Minimize the total number of nurses hired, which is the sum of all nurses starting their period throughout the week.

**Constraints:**
For each day \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \), we have to ensure that the number of working nurses meets the demand. A nurse works for \(\text{period}\) consecutive days starting from their start day. This means the demand on day \( j \) can be met by nurses who started their period on days \( j, j-1, \ldots, j-(\text{period}-1) \).

The constraints can be formulated as:
- For each day \( j \), the sum of nurses starting from day \( j-\text{mod}(k,7) \) to \( j \) must cover the demand \( d_j \).

Let's write this model in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{MILP Model for Nurse Scheduling}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $d_j$: Demand for nurses on day $j$, for $j = 1, \ldots, 7$.
    \item $\text{period}$: The number of consecutive working days.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_j$: Number of nurses that start their period on day $j$, for $j = 1, \ldots, 7$, where $x_j \in \mathbb{Z}_+$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total number of nurses:
\[
\min \sum_{j=1}^{7} x_j
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
For each day $j = 1, \ldots, 7$, the demand is satisfied by the sum of the nurses starting their period within the last $\text{period}$ days:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{\text{period}-1} x_{(j-k-1 \mod 7) + 1} \geq d_j \quad \text{for } j = 1, \ldots, 7
\]
where $(j-k-1 \mod 7) + 1$ ensures that the days are wrapped around a weekly schedule.

\end{document}
```

This model will help find the minimum number of nurses needed, ensuring that the demand for each day is met by the nurses who start their period within the required number of consecutive days.
