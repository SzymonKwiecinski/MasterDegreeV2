PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A quantity y is known to depend on another quantity x. A set of corresponding values has been collected for x and y and is presented.
- The \var{k}-th y value takes \var{y_{k}} and the \var{k}-th x value takes \var{x_{k}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "y": [y_{k} for k = 1,...,K],
    "x": [x_{k} for k = 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Fit the ‘best’ straight line y = bx + a where the objective is to minimize the maximum deviation of all the observed values of y from the value predicted by the linear relationship.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{intercept} represents the intercept of the fitted line
- \var{slope} represents the slope of the fitted line

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem using Linear Programming, the goal is to fit a straight line \( y = bx + a \) such that we minimize the maximum deviation of all the observed values of \( y \) from the values predicted by the linear relationship. This approach is known as minimizing the Chebyshev norm (or \( \ell_\infty \) norm) of the residuals.

Given the input format where you have two lists \( y = [y_k \text{ for } k = 1,...,K] \) and \( x = [x_k \text{ for } k = 1,...,K] \), the mathematical model can be constructed as follows:

1. Define decision variables \( a \) for the intercept and \( b \) for the slope of the line, and an additional variable \( D \) representing the maximum deviation (which we want to minimize).

2. The objective function is to minimize \( D \).

3. The constraints ensure that the deviation of each predicted value \( y_k \) from the observed value is bounded by \( D \), both positively and negatively. This can be represented as:

\[
y_k - (bx_k + a) \leq D \quad \forall k
\]
\[
(bx_k + a) - y_k \leq D \quad \forall k
\]

Here's the linear programming model formulated in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

Objective: Minimize \( D \)

Subject to constraints:
\begin{align*}
y_k - (bx_k + a) &\leq D, \quad \forall k \\
(bx_k + a) - y_k &\leq D, \quad \forall k
\end{align*}

Decision Variables:
\begin{align*}
a & : \text{Intercept of the fitted line} \\
b & : \text{Slope of the fitted line} \\
D & : \text{Maximum deviation to be minimized}
\end{align*}

\end{document}
```

Once the above linear program is solved using an LP solver, the output will include the values for the `intercept` (variable \( a \)) and the `slope` (variable \( b \)) which represent the parameters of the best fit line according to the specified objective.
