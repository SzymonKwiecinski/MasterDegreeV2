PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
        for id in 1, ..., m
    ],
    "total_cost": total_cost

\section*{Mathematical Model for Soybean Transportation Problem}

We need to determine the quantity of soybeans to ship from terminal cities to destination cities via port cities such that the total transportation cost is minimized.

\subsection*{Sets and Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $A$ be the set of all routes.
    \item Let $C_{i,j}$ be the transportation cost per metric ton on route $(i, j)$.
    \item Let $supply_{k}$ be the supply at terminal city $k$.
    \item Let $demand_{l}$ be the demand at destination city $l$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{i,j}$: The amount of soybeans transported from city $i$ to city $j$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}

Minimize the total transportation cost:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \times x_{i,j}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Supply constraints at each terminal city $k$:
    \[
    \sum_{j : (k, j) \in A} x_{k,j} \leq supply_{k} \quad \forall k
    \]
    \item Demand constraints at each destination city $l$:
    \[
    \sum_{i : (i, l) \in A} x_{i,l} \geq demand_{l} \quad \forall l
    \]
    \item Flow conservation constraints at each port city $p$:
    \[
    \sum_{i : (i, p) \in A} x_{i,p} = \sum_{j : (p, j) \in A} x_{p,j} \quad \forall p
    \]
    \item Non-negativity constraints:
    \[
    x_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \forall (i,j) \in A
    \]
\end{itemize}

The solution to this model will provide the optimal transportation plan that minimizes the cost of shipping soybeans from the terminal cities to the destination cities.
