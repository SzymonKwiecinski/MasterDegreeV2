PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- Consider a set \var{P} described by linear inequality constraints, that is:
 \var{P} = {\var{x} \in R^\var{N} | \var{a_i}^T x <= \var{b_i} , i = 1, ..., m}.

where \var{a_i} \in R^\var{N} and \var{b_i} \in R

- A ball with center \var{y} in R^\var{N} and radius \var{r} is defined as the set of all points within (Euclidean) distance \var{r} from \var{y}.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "A": [[a_i_j for j in 1, ..., n] for i in 1, ..., m],
    "b": [b_i for i in 1, ..., m]
}

OBJECTIVE: We are interested in finding a ball with the largest possible radius, which is entirely contained within the set \var{P} (The center of such a ball is called the Chebychev center of \var{P}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- center (list): The center of the ball as a list of floats of length \var{N}
- radius (float): The radius of the ball as a float

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "center": [y_j for j in 1, ..., n],
    "radius": r
}

To solve this problem, we need to find the Chebychev center of the polyhedron defined by the set of linear inequality constraints. The Chebychev center is the center of the largest ball that can be fitted inside the polyhedron. This is a linear programming problem where the objective is to maximize the radius of the ball.

Let's construct the linear programming model for this problem in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Problem Formulation:}

Given a set \( P \) defined by linear inequalities:
\[
P = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^N \mid a_i^T x \leq b_i, \, i = 1, \ldots, m \}
\]

We want to find a ball with center \( y \) and radius \( r \) that is entirely contained within \( P \).

\textbf{LP Formulation:}

Let \( y \in \mathbb{R}^N \) be the center of the ball. The Euclidean distance from the center \( y \) to the hyperplane \( a_i^T x = b_i \) must be at least \( r \) for all \( i \).

The Euclidean distance constraint can be expressed using the Euclidean norm (Chebyshev norm in this context because we are maximizing the smallest distance), leading to:
\[
a_i^T y + \| a_i \|_2 r \leq b_i, \, i = 1, \ldots, m
\]

Thus, the LP formulation is:
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \max \quad r \\
& \text{subject to} \\
& a_i^T y + \| a_i \|_2 r \leq b_i, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m \\
& y \in \mathbb{R}^N, \quad r \geq 0
\end{aligned}
\]

\end{document}
```

In this formulation:
- \( y \) is the vector of the center of the ball.
- \( r \) is the radius of the ball.
- \( \| a_i \|_2 \) is the Euclidean norm of the vector \( a_i \).

This linear programming problem can be solved using any optimization tool that handles LP problems. The solution will give us the center \( y \) and the radius \( r \) of the largest possible ball contained inside the polyhedron.
