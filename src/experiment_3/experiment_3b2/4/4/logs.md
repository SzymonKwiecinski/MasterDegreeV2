<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- A hospital wants to make a weekly night shift (12pm-8am) schedule for its nurses. 
- The demand for nurses for the night shift on day \var{j} = 1,...,7 is an integer \var{d_j}. 
- Every nurse works \var{period} days in a row on the night shift, followed by (7 - \var{period}) days off.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "period": period,
    "demand": [d_j for j in 1, ...,7]
}

OBJECTIVE: The goal is to find the minimal number of nurses the hospital needs to hire. 

OUTPUT INFO: 

- for each day \var{j} = 1,...,7, \var{start_j} which shows the number of nurses that start their period on day \var{j}.
- the total number of nurses hired.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "start": [start_j for j in 1, ...,7],
    "total": total
}

To model the given problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, we can define decision variables and constraints as follows:

1. **Decision Variables**:
   - Let \( x_j \) be the number of nurses that start their working period on day \( j \), where \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \).

2. **Objective Function**:
   - Minimize the total number of nurses hired, which can be expressed as the sum of all nurses starting their period on any day of the week:

   \[
   \text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{j=1}^{7} x_j
   \]

3. **Constraints**:
   - Satisfy the demand for nurses each day. For each day \( j \), the number of nurses on duty should be at least \( d_j \). The number of nurses on duty on any particular day will be the sum of those who started their period on that day and those who started their period in the previous \( \text{period} - 1 \) days. For day \( j \), this can be expressed as:

   \[
   \sum_{k=0}^{\text{period}-1} x_{(j-k-1) \mod 7 + 1} \geq d_j, \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, 7
   \]

   Here, \( (j-k-1) \mod 7 + 1 \) accounts for circular wrap-around using modulo operation, ensuring that the indexing stays within the range 1 to 7.

Let's write this model in LaTeX format.

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Problem Formulation:}

\begin{align*}
    \text{Minimize} \quad & \sum_{j=1}^{7} x_j \\
    \text{subject to} \quad & \sum_{k=0}^{\text{period}-1} x_{(j-k-1) \mod 7 + 1} \geq d_j, \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, 7 \\
    & x_j \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}, \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, 7
\end{align*}

\end{document}
```

This model ensures that the hospital hires the minimal number of nurses while meeting the demand for each day of the week, adhering to the constraint that nurses work for a specified continuous period and then have days off.
