PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

To solve this problem, we need to create a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. The goal is to minimize the number of floppy disks used to store all files without exceeding the capacity of any disk. 

Here's how we can formulate this problem:

1. **Decision Variables**:
   - \( x_{ij} \): A binary variable that is 1 if file \( j \) is stored on disk \( i \), and 0 otherwise.
   - \( y_{i} \): A binary variable that is 1 if disk \( i \) is used, and 0 otherwise.

2. **Objective**:
   - Minimize the total number of disks used, i.e., \( \sum_{i} y_{i} \).

3. **Constraints**:
   - Each file must be stored on exactly one disk: \( \sum_{i} x_{ij} = 1 \) for all \( j \).
   - The total size of the files on any disk must not exceed the disk's capacity: \( \sum_{j} \text{size}_{j} \cdot x_{ij} \leq \text{capacity} \cdot y_{i} \) for all \( i \).
   - If a file is assigned to a disk, that disk must be marked as used.

Given the input format, here's a mathematical formulation of the problem in LaTeX:

\section*{MILP Formulation for Floppy Disk Backup Problem}

\textbf{Given:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\text{capacity}\): Capacity of each floppy disk in GB.
    \item \(\text{size}_j\): Size of file \(j\) for \(j = 1, \ldots, N\).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}\) is 1 if file \(j\) is placed on disk \(i\), and 0 otherwise.
    \item \(y_i \in \{0, 1\}\) is 1 if disk \(i\) is used, and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective:}
Minimize the number of disks used:
\[
\text{minimize} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{M} y_i
\]
where \(M\) is an upper bound on the number of disks that might be needed (e.g., \(M = N\)).

\textbf{Constraints:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each file must be stored on exactly one disk:
    \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{M} x_{ij} = 1, \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, N
    \]
    \item Disk capacity constraints for each disk:
    \[
    \sum_{j=1}^{N} \text{size}_j \cdot x_{ij} \leq \text{capacity} \cdot y_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M
    \]
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Output:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\text{n\_disks} = \sum_{i=1}^{M} y_i\)
    \item \(\text{whichdisk} = [disk_j \text{ for each file } j]\) where \(disk_j\) is the index of the disk on which file \(j\) is placed.
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

This MILP formulation effectively captures the essence of the backup problem by ensuring each file is assigned to exactly one disk while minimizing the number of disks utilized.
