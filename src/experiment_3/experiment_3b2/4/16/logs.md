PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- A manager of an oil refinery has \var{allocated_i} million barrels of crude oil type \var{i} allocated for production during the coming month. 
- These resources can be used to make \var{P} different products. product \var{p} sells for $ \var{price_p} per barrel.
- There are \var{L} production processes. Process \var{l} uses \var{input_l_i} barrels of each crude \var{i}, and produces \var{output_l_p} barrels of each product \var{p}. 
- Process \var{l} has a cost of \var{cost_l} per barrel of product produced.
- All \var{input_l_i} quantities and \var{output_l_p} quanitites are in barrels. 
- There are no separate cost items for the cost of the crudes, as they have already been allocated.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "allocated": [allocated_i for i in 1, ..., O],
    "price": [price_p for p in 1, ..., P],
    "input": [[input_l_i for i in 1, ..., O] for l in 1, ..., L],
    "output": [[output_l_p for p in 1, ..., P] for l in 1, ..., L],
    "cost": [cost_l for l in 1, ..., L]
}

OBJECTIVE: We want to know how many times should we execute each process to maximize the revenue for the next month (you can assume that the number of times that each process is executed is a floating point number)

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{revenue} is the total revenue for the month.
- \var{execute_l} is the number of times that process \var{l} should be executed.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "revenue": revenue,
    "execute": [execute_l for l in 1, ..., L]
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model the given problem as a Linear Programming (LP) problem, we need to define the decision variables, objective function, and constraints based on the provided information.

######### Decision Variables
Let \( x_l \) be the number of times process \( l \) is executed.

######### Objective Function
We aim to maximize the total revenue, which is the difference between the total sales value and the production cost for each executed process. The objective function can be expressed as:

\[
\text{maximize} \quad Z = \sum_{p=1}^{P} \left( \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{output}_{l,p} \cdot x_l \cdot \text{price}_p \right) - \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( \sum_{p=1}^{P} \text{output}_{l,p} \cdot x_l \cdot \text{cost}_l \right)
\]

######### Constraints
1. **Crude Oil Usage Constraints**: The total crude oil used by all processes must not exceed the allocated amount for each type of crude:
   \[
   \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{input}_{l,i} \cdot x_l \leq \text{allocated}_i \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, O
   \]

2. **Non-negativity Constraints**: The number of times each process is executed must be non-negative:
   \[
   x_l \geq 0 \quad \forall l = 1, \ldots, L
   \]

Given this formulation, we can now present it in LaTeX format:

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let \( x_l \) be the number of times process \( l \) is executed, where \( l = 1, \ldots, L \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Maximize the total revenue:

\[
Z = \sum_{p=1}^{P} \left( \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{output}_{l,p} \cdot x_l \cdot \text{price}_p \right) - \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( \sum_{p=1}^{P} \text{output}_{l,p} \cdot x_l \cdot \text{cost}_l \right)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. Crude Oil Usage Constraints:
   \[
   \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{input}_{l,i} \cdot x_l \leq \text{allocated}_i \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, O
   \]

2. Non-negativity Constraints:
   \[
   x_l \geq 0 \quad \forall l = 1, \ldots, L
   \]

This LaTeX document provides a complete formulation of the LP problem for maximizing revenue in the oil refinery context. The LaTeX code includes sections to define decision variables, the objective function to maximize, and the necessary constraints to adhere to resource limitations.
