\section{Problem Description}

Custom Tees is planning an online advertising campaign with \( A \) different ad types across two web companies. The company has specific goals for clicks and unique clicks from users in two age categories: 18-25 and older than 25. The objective is to minimize the cost of the ad campaign while achieving these goals.

\section{Mathematical Model}

\subsection{Decision Variables}
Let \( x_a \) be the number of clicks purchased for ad type \( a \), measured in thousands of clicks for \( a = 1, \ldots, A \).

\subsection{Objective Function}
Minimize the total cost:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{a=1}^{A} \text{cost}_a \times x_a
\]

\subsection{Constraints}

1. Achieve at least the goal number of clicks from visitors aged 18-25:
   \[
   \sum_{a=1}^{A} \text{young\_click}_a \times x_a \geq \text{goal\_young}
   \]

2. Achieve at least the goal number of clicks from visitors older than 25:
   \[
   \sum_{a=1}^{A} \text{old\_click}_a \times x_a \geq \text{goal\_old}
   \]

3. Achieve at least the goal number of unique clicks from visitors aged 18-25:
   \[
   \sum_{a=1}^{A} \text{unique\_click}_a \times \text{young\_click}_a \times x_a \geq \text{goal\_unique\_young}
   \]

4. Achieve at least the goal number of unique clicks from visitors older than 25:
   \[
   \sum_{a=1}^{A} \text{unique\_click}_a \times \text{old\_click}_a \times x_a \geq \text{goal\_unique\_old}
   \]

5. Do not exceed the maximum number of allowable clicks for each ad type:
   \[
   x_a \leq \text{max\_click}_a, \quad \forall a = 1, \ldots, A
   \]

6. Non-negativity constraints:
   \[
   x_a \geq 0, \quad \forall a = 1, \ldots, A
   \]

\section{Solution Interpretation}
The solution will provide the optimal number of clicks \( x_a \) for each ad type \( a \), and the corresponding total cost \( Z \) of the ad campaign.
