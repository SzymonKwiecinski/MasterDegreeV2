PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem, we need to formulate an optimization problem that minimizes the maximum thrust (or acceleration) required at any time step \( t \) while ensuring that the rocket reaches the target position \( x_T \) with velocity \( v_T \) at time \( T \). The constraints include the equations of motion and the initial conditions.

Below is the mathematical formulation of the problem, along with the constraints and objective function:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Objective:} 

Minimize the maximum thrust required, which is \(\max_t |a_t|\). 

\textbf{Constraints:}
\begin{align*}
& x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t, \quad t = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, T-1, \\
& v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t, \quad t = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, T-1, \\
& x_0 \text{ given}, \\
& v_0 \text{ given}, \\
& x_T \text{ target position}, \\
& v_T \text{ target velocity}.
\end{align*}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{align*}
& a_t \text{ for } t = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, T-1, \\
& x_t \text{ for } t = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, T, \\
& v_t \text{ for } t = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, T.
\end{align*}

\textbf{Optimization Problem:}
\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize} \quad & \max_{t=0, 1, \ldots, T-1} |a_t| \\
\text{subject to:} \quad & x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t, \quad t = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, T-1, \\
& v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t, \quad t = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, T-1, \\
& x_0 \text{ is given}, \\
& v_0 \text{ is given}, \\
& x_T \text{ is the target position}, \\
& v_T \text{ is the target velocity}.
\end{align*}

\textbf{Fuel Consumption:}
The total fuel spent can be assumed to be proportional to the sum of absolute accelerations, i.e.,
\[
\text{fuel\_spend} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\end{document}
```

This linear programming formulation seeks to minimize the maximum of the absolute values of the accelerations \( a_t \), which correspond to minimizing the peak thrust required. The total fuel spent is given by the sum of the absolute values of the accelerations over all time steps. The constraints ensure that the rocket's position and velocity follow the discrete-time equations of motion, starting from given initial conditions and reaching the specified target conditions at time \( T \).
