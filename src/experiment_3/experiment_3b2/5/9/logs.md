PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a road divided into \var{N} segments that is illuminated by \var{M} lamps.
- Let \var{power_j} be the power of the \var{j}-th lamp. The illumination \var{ill_i} of the \var{i}-th segment is assumed to be \sum_{j=1}^{\var{M}} \var{coeff_{i,j}} \var{power_j}, where \var{coeff_{i,j}} are known coefficients.
- Let \var{desired_i} be the desired illumination of road \var{i}. 
- We are interested in choosing the lamp powers \var{power_j} so that the illuminations {ill_i} are close to the desired illuminations {desired_i}. 

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "coeff": [[coeff_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., M] for i in 1, ..., N],
    "desired": [desired_i for i in 1, ..., N]
}

OBJECTIVE: Find the lamp powers \var{power_j} that minimize the absolute error between the illuminations {ill_i} and the desired illuminations {desired_i}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{power_j} is the optimal power of the \var{j}-th lamp.
- \var{error} is the absolute error between the illuminations {ill_i} and the desired illuminations {desired_i}.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "power": [power_j for j in 1, ..., M]
    "error": error
}

To solve this problem, we can formulate a linear programming model that minimizes the absolute error between the actual illumination of each segment and the desired illumination. We will introduce auxiliary variables to handle the absolute values.

Below is the mathematical model:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Minimizing Illumination Error}

Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N$: Number of road segments
    \item $M$: Number of lamps
    \item $\text{coeff}_{i,j}$: Coefficients representing the contribution of lamp $j$ to segment $i$
    \item $\text{desired}_i$: Desired illumination for segment $i$
\end{itemize}

Variables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\text{power}_j$: Power of lamp $j$, for $j = 1, \ldots, M$
    \item $\text{error}_i$: Absolute error for segment $i$, for $i = 1, \ldots, N$
\end{itemize}

Objective:
\[
\min \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{error}_i
\]

Subject to:
\[
\forall i = 1, \ldots, N:
\]
\[
\text{ill}_i = \sum_{j=1}^{M} \text{coeff}_{i,j} \cdot \text{power}_j
\]
\[
-\text{error}_i \leq \text{ill}_i - \text{desired}_i \leq \text{error}_i
\]

where $\text{ill}_i$ is the calculated illumination for segment $i$.

\end{document}
```

This linear programming model seeks to minimize the total absolute error across all segments. For each segment $i$, the illumination $\text{ill}_i$ is calculated based on the power of the lamps and the given coefficients. The constraints ensure that the absolute error $\text{error}_i$ correctly represents the difference between the calculated and desired illuminations. By optimizing this model, we find the optimal lamp powers $\text{power}_j$ that minimize the total error.
