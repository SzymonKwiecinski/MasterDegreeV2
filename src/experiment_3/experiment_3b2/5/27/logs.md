PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"benefit": [[benefit_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...,K],
	"communication": [[communication_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
	"cost": [[cost_{l, m} for m in 1,...,L] for l in 1,...,L],
}


OBJECTIVE: Where should each department be located so as to minimize overall yearly cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{islocated_{k, l}} represents whether department \var{k} is relocated at city \var{l}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "islocated": [[islocated_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...K],

\section*{Mathematical Model for Relocation Problem}

We have the following problem parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( K \) be the number of departments.
    \item Let \( L \) be the number of cities including London.
    \item \( \text{benefit}_{k, l} \) is the benefit derived from relocating department \( k \) to city \( l \) (in thousands of pounds).
    \item \( \text{communication}_{k, j} \) is the quantity of communication between department \( k \) and department \( j \).
    \item \( \text{cost}_{l, m} \) is the unit cost of communication between city \( l \) and city \( m \).
\end{itemize}

We define the decision variable:
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{islocated}_{k, l} = 
\begin{cases} 
1, & \text{if department } k \text{ is relocated to city } l, \\
0, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
\]

The objective is to minimize the overall yearly cost, expressed by:
\[
\min \left( \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{islocated}_{k, l} \cdot \text{benefit}_{k, l} - \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{j=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{m=1}^{L} \text{islocated}_{k, l} \cdot \text{islocated}_{j, m} \cdot \text{communication}_{k, j} \cdot \text{cost}_{l, m} \right)
\]

Subject to the following constraints:
\begin{align}
\sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{islocated}_{k, l} &= 1, \quad \forall k \in \{1, \ldots, K\} \quad \text{(each department is located in exactly one city)} \\
\sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{islocated}_{k, l} &\leq 3, \quad \forall l \in \{1, \ldots, L\} \quad \text{(no city can have more than three departments)}
\end{align}
