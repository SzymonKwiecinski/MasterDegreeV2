PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- The town has \var{S} different shifts for the police officers during the day.
- During each shift \var{s}, the town requires \var{officers_needed_{s}} police officers on duty.
- Each police officer works for two consecutive shifts.
- The cost for the town when starting a shift at \var{s} is \var{shift_cost_{s}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "officers_needed": [officers_needed_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "shift_costs": [shift_cost_{s} for s in 1, ..., S]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many officers should the town assign to each shift in order to minimize the total cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- The number of officers assigned to each shift \var{officers_assigned_{s}}.
- \var{total_cost} indicates the total cost for the town.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "officers_assigned": [officers_assigned_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

To solve this problem, we need to create a linear programming model that minimizes the total cost of assigning police officers to shifts while satisfying the requirement that each shift has enough officers on duty. 

Let's define the decision variables, constraints, and objective function in a mathematical model using LaTeX.

######### Decision Variables
- \( x_s \): The number of officers starting their shift at shift \( s \).

######### Objective Function
Minimize the total cost of starting shifts, which is given by:
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{s=1}^{S} \text{shift_cost}_{s} \times x_s
\]

######### Constraints
1. **Coverage Constraint**: Each shift \( s \) needs a certain number of officers. An officer starting at shift \( s \) covers shifts \( s \) and \( s+1 \) (considering cyclic shifts if needed). Therefore, for each shift \( s \):
   \[
   x_s + x_{s-1} \geq \text{officers_needed}_s
   \]
   where \( x_{s-1} \) covers the last shift and first shift in a cyclic manner (i.e., if \( s = 1 \), then \( x_0 = x_S \)).

######### Full Mathematical Model
```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Model for Shift Scheduling}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let \( x_s \) be the number of officers starting at shift \( s \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total cost:
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad Z = \sum_{s=1}^{S} \text{shift\_cost}_{s} \times x_s
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{align*}
x_s + x_{s-1} &\geq \text{officers\_needed}_s, \quad &\forall s = 1, \ldots, S \\
x_{s} &\geq 0, \quad &\forall s = 1, \ldots, S
\end{align*}

\noindent Note: For the cyclic coverage, \( x_0 = x_S \).

\subsection*{Assumptions}
- Each officer works for exactly two consecutive shifts.
- The shifts are cyclical, meaning the shift after the last one is the first shift again.

\end{document}
```

This model will help you determine the optimal number of officers starting each shift to minimize costs while ensuring adequate coverage for all shifts. You will need to use an LP solver to compute the values for \( x_s \) and further derive the total cost.
