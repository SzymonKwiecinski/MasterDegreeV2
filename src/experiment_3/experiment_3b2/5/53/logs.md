PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}

To address the transportation problem described, we need to formulate a Linear Programming (LP) model that minimizes the transportation costs while meeting the supply constraints at each terminal and the demand requirements at each destination. Here's how you can model the problem in LaTeX format using Linear Programming:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Soybean Transportation LP Model}

We define the decision variables:
\[
x_{i,j} = \text{amount of soybeans transported from city } i \text{ to city } j
\]

The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost, given by:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j}
\]

Subject to:
- Supply constraints at each terminal \( k \):
  \[
  \sum_{j: (k,j) \in A} x_{k,j} \leq \text{supply}_k \quad \forall k
  \]

- Demand constraints at each destination \( l \):
  \[
  \sum_{i: (i,l) \in A} x_{i,l} \geq \text{demand}_l \quad \forall l
  \]

- Flow balance for intermediate ports:
  \[
  \sum_{i: (i,p) \in A} x_{i,p} = \sum_{j: (p,j) \in A} x_{p,j} \quad \forall p
  \]

- Non-negativity constraints:
  \[
  x_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \forall (i,j) \in A
  \]

Where:
- \( C_{i,j} \) is the transportation cost per metric ton from city \( i \) to city \( j \).
- \( \text{supply}_k \) is the soybean supply available at terminal city \( k \).
- \( \text{demand}_l \) is the soybean demand required at destination city \( l \).
- \( A \) is the set of all possible routes.

This model will determine the optimal shipments \( x_{i,j} \) from each source to destination cities to minimize the total cost.

\end{document}
``` 

To solve this LP model, you can use optimization software tools like CPLEX, Gurobi, or open-source solvers like CBC or GLPK, which can handle LP problems efficiently. The solution will provide you with the amounts to be shipped along each route and the minimized total transportation cost.
