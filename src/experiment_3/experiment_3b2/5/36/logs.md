<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A manufacturer wishes to produce \var{alloy_quant} lb of an alloy that consists of several kinds of metals.
- And by weight, the alloy we want contains a target quantity\var{target_{m}} of metal \var{metal_{m}}.
- Several other kinds of alloys are available at various prices. 
- These alloys can be melted to get the alloy we want.
- Alloy \var{k} has \var{ratio_{k, m}} ratio of \var{metal_{m}} and is sold at price of \var{price_k}.
- Ratio \var{ratio_{k, m}} ranges between 0 and 1.0 and should be properly treated in optimization

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"alloy_quant": alloy_quant,
	"target": [target_{m} for m in 1,...,M],
	"ratio": [[ratio_{k, m} for m in 1,...,M] for k = 1,...,K],
	"price": [price_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}

OBJECTIVE: The manufacturer wishes to find the amounts of the various alloys needed and to determine the cheapest combination.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{amount} represents the quantity of each alloy we buy

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"amount": [amount_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}

To formulate this problem as a linear programming model, we need to determine the amount of each type of alloy to purchase such that the desired final alloy composition is achieved at the minimum cost.

Let's denote:
- \( x_k \) as the amount of alloy \( k \) to purchase, for \( k = 1, \ldots, K \).

The objective is to minimize the cost of purchasing the alloys. Thus, the objective function is:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{price}_k \cdot x_k
\]

Subject to the constraints ensuring that the final alloy contains the exact quantity of each metal:

1. For each metal \( m \), ensure that the total amount of metal \( m \) in the mixture matches the target. This can be expressed as:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{ratio}_{k,m} \cdot x_k = \text{target}_m \quad \text{for} \quad m = 1, \ldots, M
\]

2. The total weight of all alloys used should equal the desired quantity:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} x_k = \text{alloy\_quant}
\]

3. Non-negativity constraints for all \( x_k \):

\[
x_k \geq 0 \quad \text{for} \quad k = 1, \ldots, K
\]

Now, letâ€™s write the above formulation in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize} \quad & \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{price}_k \cdot x_k \\
\text{subject to} \quad & \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{ratio}_{k,m} \cdot x_k = \text{target}_m, \quad \text{for} \quad m = 1, \ldots, M \\
& \sum_{k=1}^{K} x_k = \text{alloy\_quant} \\
& x_k \geq 0, \quad \text{for} \quad k = 1, \ldots, K
\end{align*}

\end{document}
``` 

This model will help the manufacturer determine the quantities of each alloy to purchase at the minimum cost while satisfying the metal composition requirements.
