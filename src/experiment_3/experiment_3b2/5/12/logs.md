PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Suppose that there are \var{N} available currencies, and assume that one unit of currency \var{i} can be exchanged for \var{rate_{i,j}} units of currency \var{j} (Naturally, we assume that \var{rate_{i,j}} > 0).
- There are also certain regulations that impose a limit \var{limit_i} on the total amount of currency \var{i} that can be exchanged (whether to other currencies or from other currencies) on any given day.
- Suppose that we start the day with \var{start_i} units of currency \var{i}
- Provide a linear programming formulation of this problem. Assume that for any sequence \var{i_1}, â€¦ ,\var{i_k} of currencies, we have \var{rate_{i_1,i_2}}, \var{rate_{i_2,i_3}}, ..., \var{rate_{i_{k-1}, i_{k}}, \var{rate_{i_k, i_1}} <= 1, which means that wealth cannot be multiplied by going through a cycle of currencies.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "start": [start_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "limit": [limit_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "rate": [[rate_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., N] for i in 1, ..., N],
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to maximize the number of units of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day, through a sequence of currency transactions.

OUTPUT INFO: 

- The output json file contains a list of transactions, where each transaction is a json object with the following fields:
    - from: the currency that we are exchanging from
    - to: the currency that we are exchanging to
    - amount: the amount of currency that we are exchanging
- The output json file also contains the final amount of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day.

OUTPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": i,
            "to": j,
            "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
    ],
    "final_amount_of_currency_N": final_amount_of_currency_N

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To formulate this problem as a linear programming model, we will define the decision variables and constraints based on the given scenario. We need to maximize the amount of currency \( N \) at the end of the day. Here's the LP formulation in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Formulation for Currency Exchange}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let \( x_{i,j} \) be the amount of currency \( i \) exchanged to currency \( j \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Maximize the final amount of currency \( N \), which is:

\[
\text{Maximize } \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i,N} \times \text{rate}_{i,N}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. Currency Exchange Limit Constraints:
   \[
   \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} \leq \text{limit}_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
   \]

2. Starting Currency Amount Constraints:
   \[
   \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{j,i} \times \text{rate}_{j,i} \leq \text{start}_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
   \]

3. Non-negativity Constraints:
   \[
   x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall i, j = 1, \ldots, N
   \]

\subsection*{Interpretation}

- The objective function seeks to maximize the total units of currency \( N \) obtained through exchanges.
- The first set of constraints ensures that the total currency exchanged from each currency \( i \) does not exceed the regulatory limit.
- The second set of constraints ensures that the net currency exchange involving each currency does not exceed the available starting amount.
- The non-negativity constraints ensure that all exchanges involve non-negative amounts of currency.

\end{document}
```

This formulation effectively captures the problem's constraints and objective within a linear programming framework, allowing us to determine the optimal sequence of currency exchanges to maximize the final amount of currency \( N \).
