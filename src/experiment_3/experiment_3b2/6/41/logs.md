PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

To solve this problem, we need to formulate it as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. Below is the mathematical model for the given problem.

We need to:

1. Minimize the number of disks used.
2. Assign each file to a disk such that the total size of the files on each disk does not exceed the disk capacity.

Let's define the variables:

- Let \( N \) be the number of files.
- Let \( M \) be an upper bound on the number of disks. We can set \( M = N \) because in the worst case, each file could be on a different disk.
- Let \( y_i \) be a binary variable that is 1 if disk \( i \) is used, 0 otherwise, for \( i = 1, \ldots, M \).
- Let \( x_{ij} \) be a binary variable that is 1 if file \( j \) is placed on disk \( i \), 0 otherwise, for \( i = 1, \ldots, M \) and \( j = 1, \ldots, N \).

The mathematical model is as follows:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Objective:}

Minimize the number of disks used, given by:

\[
\min \sum_{i=1}^{M} y_i
\]

\textbf{Subject to the Constraints:}

1. Each file must be placed on exactly one disk:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{M} x_{ij} = 1, \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, N
\]

2. The total size of files on each disk must not exceed its capacity:

\[
\sum_{j=1}^{N} \text{size}_j \cdot x_{ij} \leq \text{capacity} \cdot y_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M
\]

3. \( x_{ij} \) and \( y_i \) are binary variables:

\[
x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M, \, j = 1, \ldots, N
\]

\[
y_i \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M
\]

\end{document}
```

This model will help distribute the files across the available disks in a way that minimizes the number of disks used while respecting the capacity constraint for each disk. You can use this model with an MILP solver to obtain the solution for the specific values of `capacity` and `size` provided in your input. The solution will yield the number of disks used (`n_disks`) and the specific disk assignment for each file (`whichdisk`).
