PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- Consider a set \var{P} described by linear inequality constraints, that is:
 \var{P} = {\var{x} \in R^\var{N} | \var{a_i}^T x <= \var{b_i} , i = 1, ..., m}.

where \var{a_i} \in R^\var{N} and \var{b_i} \in R

- A ball with center \var{y} in R^\var{N} and radius \var{r} is defined as the set of all points within (Euclidean) distance \var{r} from \var{y}.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "A": [[a_i_j for j in 1, ..., n] for i in 1, ..., m],
    "b": [b_i for i in 1, ..., m]
}

OBJECTIVE: We are interested in finding a ball with the largest possible radius, which is entirely contained within the set \var{P} (The center of such a ball is called the Chebychev center of \var{P}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- center (list): The center of the ball as a list of floats of length \var{N}
- radius (float): The radius of the ball as a float

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "center": [y_j for j in 1, ..., n],
    "radius": r

To solve the problem of finding the Chebychev center of a polytope defined by a set of linear inequalities, we will use Linear Programming. The goal is to maximize the radius \( r \) of an inscribed ball centered at \( y \) that fits entirely within the polytope \( P \).

######### Mathematical Formulation

We need to solve the following optimization problem:

Maximize the radius \( r \) subject to:
\[
a_i^T y + \|a_i\| r \leq b_i, \quad \forall i = 1, ..., m
\]

Where:
- \( \|a_i\| \) is the Euclidean norm of the vector \( a_i \).

This translates to a linear programming problem, as follows:

######### Linear Programming Formulation

Let \( A \) be the matrix where rows are the vectors \( a_i^T \) and \( b \) be the vector of scalars \( b_i \). The linear program can be expressed as:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{maximize} \quad & r \\
\text{subject to} \quad & A y + r \|A\|_2 \leq b \\
\end{align*}
\]

Where \( \|A\|_2 \) is a vector of the Euclidean norms of each row in matrix \( A \).

In the implementation, this would involve using a linear programming solver to find the values of \( y \) and \( r \).

######### Latex Representation

Below is the LaTeX representation of the problem:

\section*{Chebychev Center Optimization Problem}

\textbf{Objective:} Find the Chebychev center of a polytope defined by linear inequalities.

\textbf{Given:}

A set of linear inequalities defining the polytope:
\[
P = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^N \mid a_i^T x \leq b_i, \, i = 1, \ldots, m \right\}
\]

\textbf{Formulation:}

Maximize the radius \( r \) of the inscribed ball centered at \( y \), subject to:
\[
a_i^T y + \|a_i\| r \leq b_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, m
\]

Where \( \|a_i\| \) denotes the Euclidean norm of the vector \( a_i \).

\textbf{Linear Programming Formulation:}

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{maximize} \quad & r \\
\text{subject to} \quad & A y + r \|A\|_2 \leq b \\
\end{align*}
\]

Where:
- \( A \) is the matrix of vectors \( a_i^T \).
- \( \|A\|_2 \) is a vector containing the Euclidean norms of each row in \( A \).
- \( b \) is the vector of scalars \( b_i \).

\end{document}
```

To solve this problem programmatically, you would use a linear programming solver that can handle the constraints and objective as laid out in the problem formulation. This will provide the Chebychev center coordinates \( y \) and the maximum inscribed radius \( r \).
