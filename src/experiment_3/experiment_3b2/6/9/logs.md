PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a road divided into \var{N} segments that is illuminated by \var{M} lamps.
- Let \var{power_j} be the power of the \var{j}-th lamp. The illumination \var{ill_i} of the \var{i}-th segment is assumed to be \sum_{j=1}^{\var{M}} \var{coeff_{i,j}} \var{power_j}, where \var{coeff_{i,j}} are known coefficients.
- Let \var{desired_i} be the desired illumination of road \var{i}. 
- We are interested in choosing the lamp powers \var{power_j} so that the illuminations {ill_i} are close to the desired illuminations {desired_i}. 

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "coeff": [[coeff_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., M] for i in 1, ..., N],
    "desired": [desired_i for i in 1, ..., N]
}

OBJECTIVE: Find the lamp powers \var{power_j} that minimize the absolute error between the illuminations {ill_i} and the desired illuminations {desired_i}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{power_j} is the optimal power of the \var{j}-th lamp.
- \var{error} is the absolute error between the illuminations {ill_i} and the desired illuminations {desired_i}.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "power": [power_j for j in 1, ..., M]
    "error": error

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve the problem of determining the optimal powers of the lamps that minimize the absolute error between the actual and desired illumination of the road segments, we can formulate a linear programming (LP) model. The absolute error can be represented by introducing auxiliary variables and constraints. Here's how we can set up the LP in a mathematical formulation and express it in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Optimal Lamp Power}

Let \( N \) be the number of road segments and \( M \) be the number of lamps.

\subsection*{Variables}
- \( \text{power}_j \) for \( j = 1, \ldots, M \): Power of the \( j \)-th lamp.
- \( \text{error}_i \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, N \): Absolute error between the actual and desired illumination of the \( i \)-th segment.

\subsection*{Parameters}
- \( \text{coeff}_{i,j} \): Coefficient representing the effect of the \( j \)-th lamp on the \( i \)-th segment.
- \( \text{desired}_i \): Desired illumination level for the \( i \)-th segment.

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to minimize the total absolute error over all segments:

\[
\min \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{error}_i
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
For each road segment \( i \), the illumination is calculated as:

\[
\text{ill}_i = \sum_{j=1}^{M} \text{coeff}_{i,j} \cdot \text{power}_j
\]

We define the absolute error with the following constraints:

\[
\text{ill}_i - \text{desired}_i \leq \text{error}_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
\]

\[
\text{desired}_i - \text{ill}_i \leq \text{error}_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
\]

Where:
- \( \text{ill}_i \) is the calculated illumination of the \( i \)-th segment.
- \( \text{error}_i \) is a non-negative variable representing the absolute error.

\subsection*{Non-negativity Constraints}
- \( \text{power}_j \geq 0, \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, M \)
- \( \text{error}_i \geq 0, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N \)

\end{document}
```

This LaTeX document describes a linear programming model where the objective is to minimize the total absolute error in illumination for road segments by optimizing the power settings of the lamps. The model employs auxiliary variables to handle the absolute value in the error calculation, ensuring that it aligns with linear programming constraints.

For each road segment \( i \), the illumination is calculated as:

\[

Where:
- \( \text{ill}_i \) is the calculated illumination of the \( i \)-th segment.
- \( \text{error}_i \) is a non-negative variable representing the absolute error.

\subsection*{Non-negativity Constraints}
- \( \text{power}_j \geq 0, \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, M \)
