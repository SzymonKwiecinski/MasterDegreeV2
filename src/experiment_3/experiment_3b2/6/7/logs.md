PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem using Linear Programming, we need to formulate the objective and constraints in a mathematical model. The aim is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is represented by minimizing the maximum absolute value of the acceleration \(|a_t|\) across all time steps.

Here's the linear programming formulation:

######### Decision Variables:
- \( x_t \): position of the rocket at time \( t \)
- \( v_t \): velocity of the rocket at time \( t \)
- \( a_t \): acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \)
- \( M \): maximum absolute acceleration, \( M = \max_t |a_t| \)

######### Parameters:
- \( x_0 \): initial position
- \( v_0 \): initial velocity
- \( x_T \): target position at time \( T \)
- \( v_T \): target velocity at time \( T \)
- \( T \): time steps

######### Objective:
Minimize the maximum thrust required:
\[ 
\min M 
\]

######### Constraints:
1. Dynamics of the rocket:
   \[
   x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]
   \[
   v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]

2. Absolute value constraint on acceleration:
   \[
   |a_t| \leq M \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]
   This can be linearized as:
   \[
   a_t \leq M \quad \text{and} \quad -a_t \leq M \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]

3. Initial conditions:
   \[
   x_0 = \text{given initial position}
   \]
   \[
   v_0 = \text{given initial velocity}
   \]

4. Final conditions:
   \[
   x_T = \text{given target position}
   \]
   \[
   v_T = \text{given target velocity}
   \]

5. Total fuel consumption is proportional to the sum of absolute accelerations:
   \[
   \text{fuel\_spend} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
   \]

Let's create this linear programming formulation in \(\LaTeX\):

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Formulation for Rocket Trajectory Optimization}

\subsection*{Objective}
Minimize the maximum absolute acceleration:
\[
\min M
\]

\subsection*{Subject to Constraints}

\begin{align}
& x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1, \\
& v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1, \\
& a_t \leq M, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1, \\
& -a_t \leq M, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1, \\
& x_0 = \text{given }, \\
& v_0 = \text{given }, \\
& x_T = \text{given }, \\
& v_T = \text{given }.
\end{align}

\subsection*{Fuel Consumption}
The total fuel spent is calculated as:
\[
\text{fuel\_spend} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\end{document}
```

This \(\LaTeX\) code describes the linear programming model for optimizing the rocket's trajectory to minimize the maximum thrust required. You can implement this model using a linear programming solver to find the optimal trajectory and fuel consumption.
