PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }

    ],
    "total_cost": total_cost

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this transportation problem as a Linear Programming (LP) problem, we need to define the decision variables, objective function, and constraints. The goal is to minimize the transportation cost while satisfying supply and demand constraints.

**Decision Variables:**

- \( x_{i,j} \): the amount of soybeans transported from city \( i \) to city \( j \).

**Objective Function:**

We aim to minimize the total transportation cost:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j}
\]

where \( C_{i,j} \) is the transport cost per metric ton for route from city \( i \) to city \( j \).

**Constraints:**

1. **Supply Constraints:** For each terminal city \( k \), the total amount shipped from \( k \) should not exceed its supply.

\[
\sum_{j: (k, j) \in A} x_{k,j} \leq \text{supply}_{k}, \quad \forall k
\]

2. **Demand Constraints:** For each destination city \( l \), the total amount received at \( l \) should meet its demand.

\[
\sum_{i: (i, l) \in A} x_{i,l} = \text{demand}_{l}, \quad \forall l
\]

3. **Flow Conservation for Port Cities:** The total inflow into a port city \( p \) should equal total outflow from the port city.

\[
\sum_{i: (i, p) \in A} x_{i,p} = \sum_{j: (p, j) \in A} x_{p,j}, \quad \forall p
\]

4. **Non-negativity Constraints:**

\[
x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall (i,j) \in A
\]

Here's the LP model in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\textbf{Linear Programming Model for Soybean Transportation:}

\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize } & Z = \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j} \\
\text{subject to} & \\
& \sum_{j: (k, j) \in A} x_{k,j} \leq \text{supply}_{k}, \quad \forall k \text{ (Supply constraints)} \\
& \sum_{i: (i, l) \in A} x_{i,l} = \text{demand}_{l}, \quad \forall l \text{ (Demand constraints)} \\
& \sum_{i: (i, p) \in A} x_{i,p} = \sum_{j: (p, j) \in A} x_{p,j}, \quad \forall p \text{ (Flow conservation for ports)} \\
& x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall (i,j) \in A \text{ (Non-negativity constraints)}
\end{align*}

\end{document}
```

This formulation captures the necessary components to solve the problem of minimizing transportation costs while ensuring supply meets demand across the network.
