PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- Consider a communication network consisting of \var{n} nodes.
- Nodes are conÂ­nected by communication links.
- A link allowing one-way transmission from node \var{i} to node \var{j} is described by an ordered pair (\var{i},\var{j}). 
- Let \var{A} be the set of all links. 
- We assume that each link (\var{i},\var{j}) \in \var{A} can carry up to \var{U_{i,j}} bits per second. 
- There is a positive cost \var{C_{i,j}} per bit transmitted along that link. 
- Each node \var{k} generates data, at the rate of \var{B_{k,l}} bits per second, that have to be transmitted to node \var{l}, either through a direct link (\var{k}, \var{l}) or by tracing a sequence of links. 
- We allow the data with the same origin and destination to be split and be transmitted along different paths.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "links": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "U": U_{i,j},
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "data": [
        {
            "source": k,
            "destination": l,
            "rate": B_{k,l}
        }
    ]
}


OBJECTIVE: Find paths along which all data reach their intended destinations, while minimizing the total cost. 



OUTPUT INFO:
- \var{total_cost} represents the total cost of all the paths
- \var{path_cost} represents the cost of the corresponding path
- \var{path_flow} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

    "optimized_paths": {
        "paths": [
            {
                "source": k,

We are given a communication network with \( n \) nodes and a set of directed communication links \( A \), where each link \( (i,j) \in A \) can carry up to \( U_{i,j} \) bits per second at a cost of \( C_{i,j} \) per bit. We need to determine the optimal paths for transmitting data from source nodes to destination nodes while minimizing the total transmission cost.

To model the problem as a linear programming (LP) problem, we define the following decision variables:

\[
x_{k,l}^{i,j} : \text{the flow of data from source node } k \text{ to destination node } l \text{ through link } (i,j).
\]

Objective function:
Minimize the total cost of transmitting all data, which is given by:

\[
\min \sum_{(i,j) \in A} \sum_{k,l} C_{i,j} \cdot x_{k,l}^{i,j}
\]

Subject to the constraints:

1. **Flow conservation constraints:**

   For each node \( m \) that is not a source or destination for any data:

   \[
   \sum_{j: (m,j) \in A} x_{k,l}^{m,j} - \sum_{i: (i,m) \in A} x_{k,l}^{i,m} = 
   \begin{cases} 
   B_{k,l}, & \text{if } m = k \\
   -B_{k,l}, & \text{if } m = l \\
   0, & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
   \]

2. **Capacity constraints:**

   For each link \( (i,j) \in A \):

   \[
   \sum_{k,l} x_{k,l}^{i,j} \leq U_{i,j}
   \]

3. **Non-negativity constraints:**

   \[
   x_{k,l}^{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \forall k,l,i,j
   \]

This linear programming formulation ensures that the data is routed in such a way that the total cost is minimized, while satisfying the demands at each source node and adhering to the capacity constraints on each link.
