PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"benefit": [[benefit_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...,K],
	"communication": [[communication_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
	"cost": [[cost_{l, m} for m in 1,...,L] for l in 1,...,L],
}


OBJECTIVE: Where should each department be located so as to minimize overall yearly cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{islocated_{k, l}} represents whether department \var{k} is relocated at city \var{l}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "islocated": [[islocated_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...K],
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem as a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem, we define the decision variables, objective function, and constraints. Below is the mathematical formulation in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Model}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( \text{islocated}_{k, l} \) be a binary variable such that:
    \[
    \text{islocated}_{k, l} = 
    \begin{cases} 
    1, & \text{if department } k \text{ is located in city } l \\
    0, & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{benefit}_{k, l} \) is the benefit for department \( k \) from relocation at city \( l \) (in thousands of pounds).
    \item \( \text{communication}_{k, j} \) is the quantity of communication between department \( k \) and city \( j \).
    \item \( \text{cost}_{l, m} \) is the unit cost of communication between city \( l \) and city \( m \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the overall yearly cost, which includes the benefits and communication costs:
\[
\min \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( -\text{benefit}_{k, l} \cdot \text{islocated}_{k, l} \right) + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{j=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{m=1}^{L} \left( \text{communication}_{k, j} \cdot \text{cost}_{l, m} \cdot \text{islocated}_{k, l} \cdot \text{islocated}_{j, m} \right)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each department must be located in exactly one city:
    \[
    \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{islocated}_{k, l} = 1, \quad \forall k \in \{1, \ldots, K\}
    \]
    \item No city can host more than three departments:
    \[
    \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{islocated}_{k, l} \leq 3, \quad \forall l \in \{1, \ldots, L\}
    \]
    \item Binary constraints for decision variables:
    \[
    \text{islocated}_{k, l} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall k \in \{1, \ldots, K\}, \forall l \in \{1, \ldots, L\}
    \]
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

This model sets up a MIP problem with the objective of minimizing the overall cost of department relocations, balanced against benefits and communication costs. The constraints ensure each department is moved to exactly one city and limit the number of departments that can be located in each city to three. Each binary decision variable indicates whether a department is located in a specific city.

The main change was updating the string format of `data_json` to use double quotes instead of single quotes, which is required for valid JSON.
