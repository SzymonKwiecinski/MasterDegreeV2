<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- An Italian transport company must send empty containers from its depots to ports. 
- The number of containers available in the depot \var{i} is denoted with \var{numdepot_i}. 
- Container requirement in port \var{j} is \var{numport_{j}}. 
- Transport of containers is by barges. 
- Each barge can only contain two containers and the cost of transport (per barge) is proportional to the distance traveled (price is \var{price} Euros/km).
- The distances between depot \var{i} and port \var{j} is \var{distance_{i, j}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"numdepot": [numdepot_{i} for i in 1,...,I],
	"numport": [numport_{j} for j in 1,...,J],
	"price": price,
	"distance": [[distance_{i, j} for i in 1,...I] for j in 1,...,J]
}


OBJECTIVE: Minimize the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT INFO:

\var{number} represents the number of containers sent from each depot to port

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"number": [[number_{i, j} for i in 1,...,I] for j in 1,...,J]
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To formulate this problem as a Linear Programming (LP) model, we will define the variables, objective function, and constraints based on the given input information. The decision variables will represent the number of containers transported from each depot to each port. The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost. Let's translate the given problem description into a formal LP model in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let \( x_{i, j} \) be the number of containers sent from depot \( i \) to port \( j \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total transportation cost:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{i=1}^{I} \sum_{j=1}^{J} \frac{x_{i, j}}{2} \cdot \text{price} \cdot \text{distance}_{i, j}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. Supply constraints for each depot:
   \[
   \sum_{j=1}^{J} x_{i, j} \leq \text{numdepot}_{i}, \quad \forall \, i = 1, \ldots, I
   \]

2. Demand constraints for each port:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{I} x_{i, j} = \text{numport}_{j}, \quad \forall \, j = 1, \ldots, J
   \]

3. Non-negativity constraints:
   \[
   x_{i, j} \geq 0, \quad \forall \, i = 1, \ldots, I, \, j = 1, \ldots, J
   \]

\subsection*{Notes}
- The coefficient \(\frac{1}{2}\) in the objective function accounts for the fact that each barge can carry two containers.

\end{document}
```

In this LP model:
- \( x_{i, j} \) represents the number of containers sent from depot \( i \) to port \( j \).
- The objective function minimizes the cost of transporting these containers, where each barge can carry two containers, and the cost is based on the distance and price per kilometer.
- The constraints ensure that we do not exceed the supply available at each depot and that we meet the demand at each port.
- All decision variables are non-negative, as they represent the number of containers.
