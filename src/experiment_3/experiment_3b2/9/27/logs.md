PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"benefit": [[benefit_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...,K],
	"communication": [[communication_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
	"cost": [[cost_{l, m} for m in 1,...,L] for l in 1,...,L],
}


OBJECTIVE: Where should each department be located so as to minimize overall yearly cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{islocated_{k, l}} represents whether department \var{k} is relocated at city \var{l}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "islocated": [[islocated_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...K],
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To address this problem, we need to formulate a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model that minimizes the overall yearly cost, which is a combination of negative benefits (cost savings) and communication costs. Let's define the decision variables and the model:

1. **Decision Variables:**
   - \( x_{kl} \): Binary variable, where \( x_{kl} = 1 \) if department \( k \) is located in city \( l \), and \( 0 \) otherwise.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - We aim to minimize the total cost, which involves maximizing the benefits from relocating departments minus the communication costs.

3. **Constraints:**
   - Each department can only be located in one city.
   - No city can host more than three departments.
   - Binary constraints for the decision variables.

Here is the mathematical formulation in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Mathematical Model:}

\textbf{Sets and Indices:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( k \in \{1, \ldots, K\} \): Departments
    \item \( l, m \in \{1, \ldots, L\} \): Cities
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\text{benefit}_{k, l}\): Benefit (in thousands of pounds) if department \( k \) is located in city \( l \).
    \item \(\text{communication}_{k, j}\): Communication requirement between department \( k \) and department \( j \).
    \item \(\text{cost}_{l, m}\): Unit cost of communication between city \( l \) and city \( m \).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_{kl} \): Binary variable, 1 if department \( k \) is located in city \( l \), 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective Function:}
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad -\sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{benefit}_{k, l} \cdot x_{kl} + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{j=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{m=1}^{L} \text{communication}_{k, j} \cdot \text{cost}_{l, m} \cdot x_{kl} \cdot x_{jm}
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}
\begin{align}
    & \sum_{l=1}^{L} x_{kl} = 1, \quad \forall k \in \{1, \ldots, K\} \quad \text{(Each department must be in one city)} \\
    & \sum_{k=1}^{K} x_{kl} \leq 3, \quad \forall l \in \{1, \ldots, L\} \quad \text{(No city can have more than 3 departments)} \\
    & x_{kl} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall k \in \{1, \ldots, K\}, l \in \{1, \ldots, L\} \quad \text{(Binary decision variables)}
\end{align}

\end{document}
```

This formulation clearly defines how each department should be relocated to minimize the total costs considering both relocation benefits and communication costs. The decision variables are binary to indicate whether or not a department is located in a specific city.
