PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- A manager of an oil refinery has \var{allocated_i} million barrels of crude oil type \var{i} allocated for production during the coming month. 
- These resources can be used to make \var{P} different products. product \var{p} sells for $ \var{price_p} per barrel.
- There are \var{L} production processes. Process \var{l} uses \var{input_l_i} barrels of each crude \var{i}, and produces \var{output_l_p} barrels of each product \var{p}. 
- Process \var{l} has a cost of \var{cost_l} per barrel of product produced.
- All \var{input_l_i} quantities and \var{output_l_p} quanitites are in barrels. 
- There are no separate cost items for the cost of the crudes, as they have already been allocated.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "allocated": [allocated_i for i in 1, ..., O],
    "price": [price_p for p in 1, ..., P],
    "input": [[input_l_i for i in 1, ..., O] for l in 1, ..., L],
    "output": [[output_l_p for p in 1, ..., P] for l in 1, ..., L],
    "cost": [cost_l for l in 1, ..., L]
}

OBJECTIVE: We want to know how many times should we execute each process to maximize the revenue for the next month (you can assume that the number of times that each process is executed is a floating point number)

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{revenue} is the total revenue for the month.
- \var{execute_l} is the number of times that process \var{l} should be executed.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "revenue": revenue,
    "execute": [execute_l for l in 1, ..., L]
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To tackle this problem, we need to create a linear programming model aimed at maximizing revenue. The revenue is derived from selling products at their respective prices, less the costs incurred from executing production processes. Here's how the LP model is formulated:

1. **Decision Variables:**
   - \( x_l \): Number of times process \( l \) is executed (for \( l = 1, \dots, L \)).

2. **Objective Function:**
   - Maximize the total revenue:
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = \sum_{p=1}^{P} \left( \text{price}_p \times \sum_{l=1}^{L} (\text{output}_{l,p} \times x_l) \right) - \sum_{l=1}^{L} (\text{cost}_l \times \sum_{p=1}^{P} \text{output}_{l,p} \times x_l)
   \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - Crude oil allocation constraint for each type \( i \):
   \[
   \sum_{l=1}^{L} (\text{input}_{l,i} \times x_l) \leq \text{allocated}_i \quad \text{for each } i = 1, \dots, O
   \]
   - Non-negativity constraint:
   \[
   x_l \geq 0 \quad \text{for each } l = 1, \dots, L
   \]

Below is the formulation of the linear programming model in LaTeX:

Maximize the revenue:
