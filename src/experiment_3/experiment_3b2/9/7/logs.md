<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,

}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is max_t |a_t|. 

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem using Linear Programming, we formalize it as follows. We need to find the positions \(\{x_t\}\), velocities \(\{v_t\}\), and accelerations \(\{a_t\}\) for \(t = 0, 1, \ldots, T\) satisfying the given conditions, while minimizing the maximum thrust, \(\max_t |a_t|\).

######### Variables
- \(x_t\): Position at time \(t\)
- \(v_t\): Velocity at time \(t\)
- \(a_t\): Acceleration at time \(t\)

######### Constraints
1. Dynamic equations:
   \[
   x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t \quad \text{for} \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]
   \[
   v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t \quad \text{for} \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]

2. Initial conditions:
   \[
   x_0 = \text{given initial position}
   \]
   \[
   v_0 = \text{given initial velocity}
   \]

3. Target conditions at time \(T\):
   \[
   x_T = \text{desired target position}
   \]
   \[
   v_T = \text{desired target velocity}
   \]

######### Objective
Minimize the maximum thrust, which is represented as \(\max_t |a_t|\).

We can introduce an auxiliary variable \(M\) to represent the maximum absolute acceleration:

- Objective: Minimize \(M\)
- Subject to: 
  \[
  -M \leq a_t \leq M \quad \text{for} \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
  \]

######### Linear Programming Model

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Rocket Path Optimization}

\subsection*{Variables}
- \(x_t\) is the position of the rocket at time \(t\) for \(t = 0, \ldots, T\).
- \(v_t\) is the velocity of the rocket at time \(t\) for \(t = 0, \ldots, T\).
- \(a_t\) is the acceleration of the rocket at time \(t\) for \(t = 0, \ldots, T-1\).
- \(M\) is the maximum absolute value of acceleration.

\subsection*{Objective}
\[
\min M
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{align}
x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, & t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t, & t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
x_0 &= \text{given initial position} \\
v_0 &= \text{given initial velocity} \\
x_T &= \text{desired target position} \\
v_T &= \text{desired target velocity} \\
-M &\leq a_t \leq M, & t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
\end{align}

\end{document}
```

This LP formulation will provide us with the solution to minimize the maximum thrust required during the rocket flight within the given constraints.
