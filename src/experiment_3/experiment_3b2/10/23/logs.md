PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements in future years. 
- Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. 
- In addition to this, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, which will reduce the need for workers in all categories.
- The estimated manpower requirements for manpower \var{k} in year \var{i} is \var{requirement_{k, i}}.
- The current strength of manpower \var{k} is \var{strength_{k}}.
- The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to recruitment, retraining, redundancy and short-time working in the next years.
- There is a natural wastage of labour. 
- A fairly large number of workers leave during their first year. After this, the rate is much smaller. 
- Taking this into account, the wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with less than one year's service is \var{lessonewaste_{k}}.
- The wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with more than one year's service is \var{moreonewaste_{k}}.
- There has been no recent recruitment and all workers in the current labour force have been employed for more than one year.
- It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. 
- In any one year, the numbers that can be recruited in manpower \var{k} is \var{recruit_{k}}.
- The redundancy payment to manpower \var{k} is \var{costredundancy_{k}}.
- It is possible to employ up to \var{num_overman} more workers over the whole company than are needed, but the extra costs per employee per year is \var{costoverman_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- Up to \var{num_shortwork} workers in each category of skill can be put on short-time working. 
- The cost of this (per employee per year) is \var{costshort_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of half a full-time employee.

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To formulate this problem as a linear programming model, we'll define the decision variables, the objective function, and the constraints.

######### Decision Variables:

- \( \text{recruit}_{k,i} \): Number of new recruits in manpower category \( k \) for year \( i \).
- \( \text{overmanning}_{k,i} \): Number of excess workers in manpower category \( k \) for year \( i \).
- \( \text{short}_{k,i} \): Number of workers on short-time working in manpower category \( k \) for year \( i \).
- \( \text{redundancy}_{k,i} \): Number of workers made redundant in manpower category \( k \) for year \( i \).

######### Objective Function:
Minimize the total cost, which includes redundancy payments, costs of overmanning, and costs for workers on short-time working.

######### Constraints:

1. **Manpower Balance**: For each year and manpower category, the number of workers needed equals the initial strength minus wastage plus recruits minus redundancies plus overmanning plus short-time contribution.
2. **Wastage**: Incorporate the wastage rates for workers with more or less than one year's service.
3. **Recruitment Limits**: Limit the number of recruits to the specified maximum.
4. **Overmanning Limit**: Limit the total overmanning across all categories.
5. **Short-time Working Limit**: Limit short-time working per manpower category.
6. **Non-negativity**: Ensure all decision variables are non-negative.

Let's put this into a mathematical formulation using LaTeX.

\begin{align*}
\text{recruit}_{k,i} & : \text{Number of recruits in manpower category } k \text{ for year } i. \\
\text{overmanning}_{k,i} & : \text{Number of excess workers in manpower category } k \text{ for year } i. \\
\text{short}_{k,i} & : \text{Number of workers on short-time working in manpower category } k \text{ for year } i. \\
\text{redundancy}_{k,i} & : \text{Number of workers made redundant in manpower category } k \text{ for year } i.
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Objective}

Minimize the total cost:

\begin{align*}
\min \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{i=1}^{I} \left( 
\text{costredundancy}_k \cdot \text{redundancy}_{k, i} 
+ \text{costoverman}_k \cdot \text{overmanning}_{k, i}
+ \text{costshort}_k \cdot \text{short}_{k, i}
\right)
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. \textbf{Manpower Balance:}

\begin{align*}
\text{strength}_{k,i} = \text{strength}_{k} - (\text{moreonewaste}_k \cdot \text{strength}_{k}) + \text{recruit}_{k,i} - \text{redundancy}_{k,i}
+ \text{overmanning}_{k,i} + 0.5 \cdot \text{short}_{k,i} = \text{requirement}_{k,i} \quad \forall k, \forall i
\end{align*}

2. \textbf{Recruitment Limits:}

\begin{align*}
\text{recruit}_{k,i} \leq \text{recruit}_k \quad \forall k, \forall i
\end{align*}

3. \textbf{Overmanning Limit:}

\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{i=1}^{I} \text{overmanning}_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_overman}
\end{align*}

4. \textbf{Short-time Working Limit:}

\begin{align*}
\text{short}_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_shortwork} \quad \forall k, \forall i
\end{align*}

5. \textbf{Non-negativity:}

\begin{align*}
\text{recruit}_{k,i}, \text{overmanning}_{k,i}, \text{short}_{k,i}, \text{redundancy}_{k,i} \geq 0 \quad \forall k, \forall i
\end{align*}

This mathematical model captures the essence of the problem by defining the decision variables, objective function, and constraints to minimize costs while satisfying manpower requirements through recruitment, redundancy, overmanning, and short-time work adjustments.
