PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- The town has \var{S} different shifts for the police officers during the day.
- During each shift \var{s}, the town requires \var{officers_needed_{s}} police officers on duty.
- Each police officer works for two consecutive shifts.
- The cost for the town when starting a shift at \var{s} is \var{shift_cost_{s}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "officers_needed": [officers_needed_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "shift_costs": [shift_cost_{s} for s in 1, ..., S]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many officers should the town assign to each shift in order to minimize the total cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- The number of officers assigned to each shift \var{officers_assigned_{s}}.
- \var{total_cost} indicates the total cost for the town.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "officers_assigned": [officers_assigned_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this linear programming problem, we need to determine the number of police officers to assign to each shift such that the total cost is minimized while satisfying the requirement of having enough officers on duty. Since each officer covers two consecutive shifts, we'll model the decision as follows:

**Decision Variables:**
- Let \( x_s \) be the number of officers starting their shift at shift \( s \).

**Objective:**
- Minimize total cost: \( \sum_{s=1}^{S} \text{shift\_cost}_s \cdot x_s \).

**Constraints:**
- For each shift \( s \), the total number of officers on duty must meet the requirement, taking into account that an officer starting at shift \( s \) will also cover shift \( s+1 \) (and considering the cyclic nature of shifts if applicable):
  \[
  x_s + x_{s-1} \geq \text{officers\_needed}_s \quad \text{for all } s
  \]
  (Assuming \( x_0 = x_S \) for cyclic shifts)

Let's formulate this problem in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Police Officer Shift Assignment}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_s \): Number of officers starting at shift \( s \), for \( s = 1, 2, \ldots, S \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total cost:
\[
\min \sum_{s=1}^{S} \text{shift\_cost}_s \cdot x_s
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{align*}
x_s + x_{s-1} & \geq \text{officers\_needed}_s, \quad \text{for } s = 1, 2, \ldots, S \\
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Special Considerations (Cyclic Nature)}
If shifts are cyclic:
\begin{align*}
x_0 & = x_S
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Non-Negativity Constraints}
\begin{align*}
x_s & \geq 0, \quad \text{for } s = 1, 2, \ldots, S
\end{align*}

\end{document}
```

**Explanation:**
- The decision variable \( x_s \) represents the number of officers starting their shift at shift \( s \).
- The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with the shifts.
- The constraints ensure that the number of officers covering each shift (summing over the two consecutive shifts) meets or exceeds the required number of officers.
- If the shifts are cyclic (as often is the case in scheduling problems), we assume \( x_0 = x_S \) to account for wrap-around coverage.
