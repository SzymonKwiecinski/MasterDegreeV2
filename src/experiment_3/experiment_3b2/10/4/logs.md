PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- A hospital wants to make a weekly night shift (12pm-8am) schedule for its nurses. 
- The demand for nurses for the night shift on day \var{j} = 1,...,7 is an integer \var{d_j}. 
- Every nurse works \var{period} days in a row on the night shift, followed by (7 - \var{period}) days off.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "period": period,
    "demand": [d_j for j in 1, ...,7]
}

OBJECTIVE: The goal is to find the minimal number of nurses the hospital needs to hire. 

OUTPUT INFO: 

- for each day \var{j} = 1,...,7, \var{start_j} which shows the number of nurses that start their period on day \var{j}.
- the total number of nurses hired.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "start": [start_j for j in 1, ...,7],
    "total": total
}

## START MESSAGE 1 
### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, we will define variables, constraints, and the objective function within the context of the given problem.

######### Decision Variables:
- Let \( x_j \) be the number of nurses starting their \( \text{period} \) on day \( j \), where \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \).

######### Objective Function:
- Minimize the total number of nurses hired, i.e., \( \sum_{j=1}^{7} x_j \).

######### Constraints:
- For each day \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \), ensure that the number of nurses available meets the demand \( d_j \). The nurses available on day \( j \) include those who started on days that fall within the \(\text{period}\) days beforehand. 

######### Mathematical Formulation:
Given \( \text{period} \) and demands \( d_j \), the constraints can be defined as:
- On day 1: \( x_1 + x_7 + \ldots + x_{8-\text{period}} \ge d_1 \)
- On day 2: \( x_2 + x_1 + \ldots + x_{9-\text{period}} \ge d_2 \)
- \(\vdots\) 
- On day 7: \( x_7 + x_6 + \ldots + x_{13-\text{period}} \ge d_7 \)

######### Circular Representation:
We utilize a circular representation for days of the week to handle the wraparound effect in the 7-day cycle.

\section*{MILP Model for Nurse Scheduling}

\textbf{Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \text{period}: the number of consecutive days a nurse works.
    \item \( d_j \): demand for nurses on day \( j \), \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_j \): number of nurses starting their period on day \( j \), \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective:}
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad Z = \sum_{j=1}^{7} x_j
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}
For each day \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \):
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{\text{period}-1} x_{(j-i-1 \mod 7) + 1} \ge d_j
\]
where \( x_{(j-i-1 \mod 7) + 1} \) accounts for wraparound days.

\textbf{Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:}
\[
x_j \ge 0, \quad x_j \in \mathbb{Z}, \quad \text{for } j = 1, \ldots, 7
\]

\end{document}
```

This LaTeX code models the problem using MILP by defining the objective, constraints, and ensuring integer solutions. The indices have been adjusted to account for the cyclic nature of the week. This setup will help in determining both the number of nurses starting each day and the total number of nurses needed.
