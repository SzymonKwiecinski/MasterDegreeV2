PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A quantity y is known to depend on another quantity x. A set of corresponding values has been collected for x and y and is presented.
- The \var{k}-th y value takes \var{y_{k}} and the \var{k}-th x value takes \var{x_{k}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "y": [y_{k} for k = 1,...,K],
    "x": [x_{k} for k = 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Fit the ‘best’ straight line y = bx + a where the objective is to minimize the maximum deviation of all the observed values of y from the value predicted by the linear relationship.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{intercept} represents the intercept of the fitted line
- \var{slope} represents the slope of the fitted line

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}

To fit the best straight line \( y = bx + a \) such that we minimize the maximum deviation of all the observed values of \( y \) from the value predicted by the linear relationship, we can use a linear programming approach known as the minimax method. This problem involves minimizing the maximum absolute deviation of the observed values from the predicted values.

Let's denote the deviation of each observed value from the predicted value as \( d_k = |y_k - (bx_k + a)| \) for each data point \( k \). We aim to minimize the maximum deviation among all these \( d_k \).

Here's how we can set up the linear programming problem:

1. Introduce a new variable \( D \) that represents the maximum deviation. The objective is to minimize \( D \).

2. For each data point \( (x_k, y_k) \), we have two constraints to express the absolute deviation:
   \[
   y_k - (bx_k + a) \leq D
   \]
   \[
   (bx_k + a) - y_k \leq D
   \]

The mathematical formulation of the problem is:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize} \quad & D \\
\text{Subject to} \quad & y_k - (bx_k + a) \leq D, \quad \forall k = 1, 2, \ldots, K \\
& (bx_k + a) - y_k \leq D, \quad \forall k = 1, 2, \ldots, K \\
& a, b, D \text{ are real numbers}
\end{align*}
\]

Below is the LaTeX code to represent this linear programming problem:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

The goal is to fit the best straight line \( y = bx + a \) that minimizes the maximum deviation of all observed values of \( y \) from the value predicted by the linear relationship. The linear programming formulation is:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize} \quad & D \\
\text{Subject to} \quad & y_k - (bx_k + a) \leq D, \quad \forall k = 1, 2, \ldots, K \\
& (bx_k + a) - y_k \leq D, \quad \forall k = 1, 2, \ldots, K \\
& a, b, D \in \mathbb{R}
\end{align*}
\]

Where:
- \( y_k \) is the observed value of \( y \).
- \( x_k \) is the observed value of \( x \).
- \( a \) is the intercept of the line.
- \( b \) is the slope of the line.
- \( D \) is the maximum deviation.

\end{document}
``` 

This linear program can be solved using appropriate optimization software to obtain the values of the intercept and slope, minimizing the maximum deviation from the data points.
