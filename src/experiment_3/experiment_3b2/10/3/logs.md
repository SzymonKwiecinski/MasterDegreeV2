PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- A state wants to plan its electricity capacity for the next \var{T} years. 
- The state has a forecast of \var{demand_t} megawatts, presumed accurate, of the demand for electricity during year \var{t}.
- The existing capacity, which is in oil-fired plants, that will not be retired and will be available during year \var{t}, is \var{oil_t}.
- There are two alternatives for expanding electric capacity: coalÂ­ fired or nuclear power plants.
- There is a capital cost of \var{coal_cost} per megawatt of coal-fired capacity that becomes operational at the beginning of year \var{t}.
- There is a capital cost of \var{nuke_cost} per megawatt of nuclear power capacity that becomes operational at the beginning of year \var{t}.
- For various political and safety reasons, it has been decided that no more than \var{max_nuke}% of the total capacity should ever be nuclear (\var{max_nuke} is a number between 0 and 100).
- Coal plants last for \var{coal_life} years, while nuclear plants last for \var{nuke_life} years.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "demand": [demand_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "oil_cap": [oil_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "coal_cost": coal_cost,
    "nuke_cost": nuke_cost,
    "max_nuke": max_nuke,
    "coal_life": coal_life,
    "nuke_life": nuke_life,
}


OBJECTIVE: What is the capacity expansion plan that results in the minimum cost?


OUTPUT INFO:

- the output should represent how much coal and nuclear capacity should be added in each year, and how much the total cost is.
- the output should be a dictionary with three keys: "coal_cap_added", "nuke_cap_added", and "total_cost".
- the value of "coal_cap_added" should be a list of the coal capacity added in each year.
- the value of "nuke_cap_added" should be a list of the nuclear capacity added in each year.
- the value of "total_cost" should be a single floating point number showing the total cost of the system.


OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "coal_cap_added": [coal_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "nuke_cap_added": [nuke_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "total_cost": total_cost,
}

To solve this linear programming problem, we will formulate a mathematical model representing the capacity planning decision. The objective is to minimize the total cost of expanding the electric capacity while satisfying all the constraints. Here's the formulation in LaTeX:

\section*{Mathematical Model for Electricity Capacity Planning}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( T \) be the total number of years for planning.
    \item \( \text{demand}_t \) be the forecasted electricity demand in year \( t \).
    \item \( \text{oil}_t \) be the existing capacity of oil-fired plants in year \( t \).
    \item \( \text{coal\_cost} \) be the cost per megawatt of coal-fired capacity.
    \item \( \text{nuke\_cost} \) be the cost per megawatt of nuclear power capacity.
    \item \( \text{max\_nuke} \) be the maximum percentage of total capacity that can be nuclear.
    \item \( \text{coal\_life} \) be the lifespan of coal plants in years.
    \item \( \text{nuke\_life} \) be the lifespan of nuclear plants in years.
    \item \( \text{coal\_cap\_added}_t \) be the coal capacity added in year \( t \).
    \item \( \text{nuke\_cap\_added}_t \) be the nuclear capacity added in year \( t \).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective:}
Minimize the total cost:
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{t=1}^{T} \left( \text{coal\_cost} \times \text{coal\_cap\_added}_t + \text{nuke\_cost} \times \text{nuke\_cap\_added}_t \right)
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}
\begin{align}
    & \text{Coal and Nuclear Capacity Balance:} \\
    & \sum_{i = \max(1, t - \text{coal\_life} + 1)}^{t} \text{coal\_cap\_added}_i + \sum_{j = \max(1, t - \text{nuke\_life} + 1)}^{t} \text{nuke\_cap\_added}_j + \text{oil}_t \geq \text{demand}_t, \quad \forall t = 1, \ldots, T \\
    & \text{Nuclear Capacity Constraint:} \\
    & \sum_{j = \max(1, t - \text{nuke\_life} + 1)}^{t} \text{nuke\_cap\_added}_j \leq \frac{\text{max\_nuke}}{100} \left(\sum_{i = \max(1, t - \text{coal\_life} + 1)}^{t} \text{coal\_cap\_added}_i + \sum_{j = \max(1, t - \text{nuke\_life} + 1)}^{t} \text{nuke\_cap\_added}_j + \text{oil}_t \right), \quad \forall t = 1, \ldots, T \\
    & \text{Non-negativity Constraints:} \\
    & \text{coal\_cap\_added}_t \geq 0, \quad \text{nuke\_cap\_added}_t \geq 0, \quad \forall t = 1, \ldots, T
\end{align}

\end{document}
```

This LaTeX code describes the linear programming model for electricity capacity planning by minimizing total costs while satisfying demand and nuclear capacity constraints over a planning horizon of \( T \) years. The decision variables \( \text{coal\_cap\_added}_t \) and \( \text{nuke\_cap\_added}_t \) represent the new capacities added each year, subject to meeting demands, lifespan constraints, and nuclear percentage restrictions.
