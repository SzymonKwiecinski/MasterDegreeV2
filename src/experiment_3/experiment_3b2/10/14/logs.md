PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- A company produces and sells \var{P} different products. 
- The demand for each product is unlimited, but the company is constrained by cash availability and machine capacity.
- Each unit of the \var{i}-th product requires \var{hour_i} machine hours.
- There are \var{availableHours} machine hours available in the current production period.
- The production costs are \var{cost_i} per unit of the \var{i}-th product.
- The selling prices of the \var{i}-th product is \var{price_i} per unit.
- The available cash is \var{cash}.
- Furthermore, \var{investRate_i} of the sales revenues from the \var{i}-th product will be made available to finance operations during the current period.
- \var{investPercentage_i} is a number between 0 and 1
- The company could increase its available machine hours by \var{upgradeHours}, after spending \var{upgradeCost} for certain repairs. 
- The net income from each product is the revenue we get from selling it minus the production cost and the investment cost.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "cash": cash,
    "hour": [hour_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "cost": [cost_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "price": [price_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "investPercentage": [investPercentage_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "upgradeHours": upgradeHours,   
    "upgradeCost": upgradeCost,
    "availableHours": availableHours,
}

OBJECTIVE: We are aiming at maximizing total net income subject to the cash availability and machine capacity limitations

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{net_income} shows the net income of the company
- \var{production_i} shows the production quantity of the \var{i}-th product
- \var{upgrade} is a boolean variable that shows whether the company should upgrade its machine capacity or not

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "net_income": net_income,
    "production": [production_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "upgrade": true/false,
}

To address the given problem, we need to formulate a Linear Programming (LP) model to maximize the total net income of the company. The decision variables, constraints, and objective function will be set up based on the problem data. Here's the mathematical model in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Model for Maximizing Total Net Income}

\paragraph{Decision Variables:}
\begin{align*}
    x_i & : \text{Production quantity of product } i, \, \forall i = 1, \ldots, P \\
    y & : \text{Binary variable indicating whether to upgrade machine hours (1 if upgrade, 0 otherwise)}
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Objective:}
Maximize the total net income:
\begin{align*}
    \text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{i=1}^{P} \left( \text{price}_i \cdot x_i - \text{cost}_i \cdot x_i - \text{investPercentage}_i \cdot \text{price}_i \cdot x_i \right) - \text{upgradeCost} \cdot y
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Subject to Constraints:}
\begin{align*}
    & \text{Cash Constraint: } \sum_{i=1}^{P} \text{cost}_i \cdot x_i \leq \text{cash} + \sum_{i=1}^{P} \text{investPercentage}_i \cdot \text{price}_i \cdot x_i \\
    & \text{Machine Capacity Constraint: } \sum_{i=1}^{P} \text{hour}_i \cdot x_i \leq \text{availableHours} + \text{upgradeHours} \cdot y \\
    & \text{Binary Constraint: } y \in \{0, 1\} \\
    & \text{Non-negativity: } x_i \geq 0, \, \forall i = 1, \ldots, P
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Explanation:}
- The objective function seeks to maximize the total net income, which is the revenue from sales minus the production and investment costs, adjusting for the upgrade cost if machine capacity is increased.
- The cash constraint ensures that the production costs do not exceed the available cash and the cash generated by sales.
- The machine capacity constraint ensures that the total machine hours required do not exceed the available hours, with an option to upgrade.
- The binary constraint for \( y \) decides whether the company should upgrade the machine capacity.

\end{document}
```

This model, once solved using a suitable LP solver, will provide the optimal production quantities for each product, whether to upgrade the machine capacity, and the maximum net income. Ensure that the data is properly substituted into the placeholders to compute the specific values required for decision-making.
