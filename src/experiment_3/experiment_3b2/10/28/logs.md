PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A quantity y is known to depend on another quantity x. A set of corresponding values has been collected for x and y and is presented.
- The \var{k}-th y value takes \var{y_{k}} and the \var{k}-th x value takes \var{x_{k}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "y": [y_{k} for k = 1,...,K],
    "x": [x_{k} for k = 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Fit the ‘best’ straight line y = bx + a to this set of data points. The objective is to minimise the sum of absolute deviations of each observed value of y from the value predicted by the linear relationship.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{intercept} represents the intercept of the fitted line
- \var{slope} represents the slope of the fitted line

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we need to fit a straight line of the form \( y = bx + a \) to the given data points \((x_k, y_k)\) for \( k = 1, \ldots, K \). The goal is to minimize the sum of the absolute deviations of each observed value of \( y \) from the value predicted by the linear relationship. This can be formulated as a linear programming problem.

We define the variables:
- \( a \): the intercept of the fitted line.
- \( b \): the slope of the fitted line.
- \( u_k \): the absolute deviation for each point \( k \).

The objective function is to minimize the sum of \( u_k \).

The constraints are based on the absolute deviation, which can be represented as:
- \( y_k - (bx_k + a) \leq u_k \)
- \( (bx_k + a) - y_k \leq u_k \)

Let's express this problem in a linear programming formulation in LaTeX.

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Objective:} 

Minimize
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} u_k
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}
\[
y_k - (b x_k + a) \leq u_k, \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
\]
\[
(b x_k + a) - y_k \leq u_k, \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
\]
\[
u_k \geq 0, \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
\]

\textbf{Variables:}
- \( a \): intercept of the fitted line
- \( b \): slope of the fitted line
- \( u_k \): non-negative absolute deviation for each data point \( k \)

\end{document}
```

This formulation allows us to solve the problem using linear programming techniques to find the optimal values of \( a \) and \( b \). Once you have the values for \( a \) (intercept) and \( b \) (slope), these should be reported as follows:

```json
{
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}
```

where `intercept` and `slope` are the values obtained from solving the LP problem.
