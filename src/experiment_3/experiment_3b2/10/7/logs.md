PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is max_t |a_t|. 

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we need to formulate a Linear Programming (LP) model. The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which corresponds to minimizing the maximum value of \(|a_t|\) across all time steps. We have the following constraints:

1. The position update constraint: \(x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t\)
2. The velocity update constraint: \(v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t\)
3. The initial conditions: \(x(0) = x_0, v(0) = v_0\)
4. The terminal conditions: \(x(T) = x_T, v(T) = v_T\)
5. The objective is to minimize the maximum absolute value of \(a_t\).

Let's define the model in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

\paragraph{Decision Variables:}
\begin{align*}
x_t &\quad \text{Position of the rocket at time } t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T \\
v_t &\quad \text{Velocity of the rocket at time } t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T \\
a_t &\quad \text{Acceleration of the rocket at time } t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
M &\quad \text{Maximum absolute value of the acceleration, } M \geq |a_t|, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Objective:}
\[
\min M
\]

\paragraph{Subject to:}
\begin{align*}
x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
x_0 &= x_0, \\
v_0 &= v_0, \\
x_T &= x_T, \\
v_T &= v_T, \\
-M &\leq a_t \leq M, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Fuel Consumption:}
To calculate total fuel spent, we assume it is proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the accelerations:
\[
\text{Fuel Spend} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\end{document}
```

This model captures the necessary constraints and objective to find the optimal trajectory to minimize the maximum thrust required.
