PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"benefit": [[benefit_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...,K],
	"communication": [[communication_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
	"cost": [[cost_{l, m} for m in 1,...,L] for l in 1,...,L],
}


OBJECTIVE: Where should each department be located so as to minimize overall yearly cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{islocated_{k, l}} represents whether department \var{k} is relocated at city \var{l}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "islocated": [[islocated_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...K],
}

To solve this problem, we can formulate it as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem. The objective is to minimize the overall yearly cost associated with relocating departments while dealing with the constraints of benefits, communication costs, and location limits. 

Here is the mathematical model in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Model}

\textbf{Sets and Indices:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( K \) - Set of departments, indexed by \( k \)
    \item \( L \) - Set of possible cities (including London), indexed by \( l \)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{benefit}_{k, l} \) - Benefit for department \( k \) from relocation at city \( l \) (in thousands of pounds)
    \item \( \text{communication}_{k, j} \) - Communication requirement between department \( k \) and department \( j \)
    \item \( \text{cost}_{l, m} \) - Unit cost of communication between city \( l \) and city \( m \)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{islocated}_{k, l} \in \{0, 1\} \) - Binary variable indicating if department \( k \) is relocated to city \( l \) (1 if yes, 0 otherwise)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective Function:}
\[
\min \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} -\text{benefit}_{k, l} \cdot \text{islocated}_{k, l} + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{j=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{m=1}^{L} \text{communication}_{k, j} \cdot \text{cost}_{l, m} \cdot \text{islocated}_{k, l} \cdot \text{islocated}_{j, m}
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}
\begin{align}
    & \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{islocated}_{k, l} = 1, \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K \quad \text{(each department is located in exactly one city)} \\
    & \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{islocated}_{k, l} \leq 3, \quad \forall l = 1, \ldots, L \quad \text{(no more than 3 departments in any city)}
\end{align}

\end{document}
```

This model utilizes a binary decision variable \(\text{islocated}_{k, l}\) which helps decide whether a department \(k\) is located in a city \(l\). The objective function is designed to minimize the net cost by factoring in both the negative benefits (i.e., benefits appear negatively because we want to minimize total cost) and communication costs. The constraints ensure that every department is assigned to one and only one city, and no city hosts more than three departments.
