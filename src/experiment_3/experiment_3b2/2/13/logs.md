PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- Consider a set \var{P} described by linear inequality constraints, that is:
 \var{P} = {\var{x} \in R^\var{N} | \var{a_i}^T x <= \var{b_i} , i = 1, ..., m}.

where \var{a_i} \in R^\var{N} and \var{b_i} \in R

- A ball with center \var{y} in R^\var{N} and radius \var{r} is defined as the set of all points within (Euclidean) distance \var{r} from \var{y}.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "A": [[a_i_j for j in 1, ..., n] for i in 1, ..., m],
    "b": [b_i for i in 1, ..., m]
}

OBJECTIVE: We are interested in finding a ball with the largest possible radius, which is entirely contained within the set \var{P} (The center of such a ball is called the Chebychev center of \var{P}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- center (list): The center of the ball as a list of floats of length \var{N}
- radius (float): The radius of the ball as a float

OUTPUT FORMAT:

To find the Chebyshev center of the set \( P \), which is defined by the linear inequality constraints, we need to solve a linear programming problem. The Chebyshev center is the center of the largest ball that can be inscribed in the polyhedral set \( P \). This can be formulated as a linear programming problem by introducing an auxiliary variable representing the radius of the ball and ensuring that the ball is contained entirely within \( P \).

Let's derive the mathematical formulation for this problem.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

Given:
- \( P = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^N \mid a_i^T x \leq b_i, \, i = 1, \ldots, m \} \)
- A ball with center \( y \in \mathbb{R}^N \) and radius \( r \).

The objective is to maximize \( r \) such that the ball is contained within \( P \).

Formulate the constraints for the ball \( x = y \pm ru_i \) (where \( u_i \) is the normal vector along the i-th constraint):

\[
a_i^T y + r \|a_i\| \leq b_i, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m
\]

Therefore, the problem becomes:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{maximize} \quad & r \\
\text{subject to} \quad & a_i^T y + r \|a_i\| \leq b_i, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m \\
& y \in \mathbb{R}^N, \, r \geq 0
\end{align*}
\]

Here's the corresponding LaTeX code:

\section*{Chebyshev Center of a Polyhedral Set}

We aim to find the Chebyshev center of the set \( P = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^N \mid a_i^T x \leq b_i, \, i = 1, \ldots, m \} \).

\subsection*{Linear Programming Formulation}

The problem is to maximize the radius \( r \) of a ball centered at \( y \) such that the ball is entirely contained within \( P \).

This leads to the following optimization problem:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{maximize} \quad & r \\
\text{subject to} \quad & a_i^T y + r \|a_i\|_2 \leq b_i, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m \\
& y \in \mathbb{R}^N, \, r \geq 0
\end{align*}
\]

Where \( \|a_i\|_2 \) denotes the Euclidean norm of the vector \( a_i \).

\end{document}
``` 

This formulation and LaTeX code should help you structure the linear programming problem to find the Chebyshev center effectively. Ensure to solve this LP using appropriate numerical methods or solvers that handle linear programming problems.
