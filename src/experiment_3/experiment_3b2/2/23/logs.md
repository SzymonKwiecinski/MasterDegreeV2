PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements in future years. 
- Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. 
- In addition to this, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, which will reduce the need for workers in all categories.
- The estimated manpower requirements for manpower \var{k} in year \var{i} is \var{requirement_{k, i}}.
- The current strength of manpower \var{k} is \var{strength_{k}}.
- The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to recruitment, retraining, redundancy and short-time working in the next years.
- There is a natural wastage of labour. 
- A fairly large number of workers leave during their first year. After this, the rate is much smaller. 
- Taking this into account, the wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with less than one year's service is \var{lessonewaste_{k}}.
- The wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with more than one year's service is \var{moreonewaste_{k}}.
- There has been no recent recruitment and all workers in the current labour force have been employed for more than one year.
- It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. 
- In any one year, the numbers that can be recruited in manpower \var{k} is \var{recruit_{k}}.
- The redundancy payment to manpower \var{k} is \var{costredundancy_{k}}.
- It is possible to employ up to \var{num_overman} more workers over the whole company than are needed, but the extra costs per employee per year is \var{costoverman_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- Up to \var{num_shortwork} workers in each category of skill can be put on short-time working. 
- The cost of this (per employee per year) is \var{costshort_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of half a full-time employee.

To model this problem using Linear Programming in LaTeX format, we need to set up an objective function and constraints that reflect the cost minimization goal and the manpower balance requirements. Here's the formulation:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Formulation}

\textbf{Objective:} Minimize the total cost over \(I\) years.

\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{i=1}^{I} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \left(
\text{costredundancy}_k \cdot \text{redundancy}_{k,i}
+ \text{costoverman}_k \cdot \text{overmanning}_{k,i}
+ \text{costshort}_k \cdot \text{short}_{k,i}
\right)
\]

\textbf{Subject to the following constraints for each year \(i\) and manpower category \(k\):}

\begin{align*}
\text{Available manpower}_{k,i} = & \ \text{strength}_k + \text{recruitment}_{k,i} + \text{moreonewaste}_k \left(\text{strength}_k + \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} ( \text{recruitment}_{k,j} \cdot (1-\text{lessonewaste}_k) )\right) \\
& - \text{redundancy}_{k,i} + \text{overmanning}_{k,i} + 0.5 \cdot \text{short}_{k,i} \quad \forall k, \forall i
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\text{Available manpower}_{k,i} \geq & \ \text{requirement}_{k,i} \quad \forall k, \forall i\\
\text{redundancy}_{k,i} \geq & \ 0 \quad \forall k, \forall i\\
\text{recruitment}_{k,i} \leq & \ \text{recruit}_k \quad \forall k, \forall i\\
\text{overmanning}_{k,i} \leq & \ \text{num\_overman} \quad \forall k, \forall i\\
\text{short}_{k,i} \leq & \ \text{num\_shortwork} \quad \forall k, \forall i
\end{align*}

\textbf{Variables:}
- \(\text{recruitment}_{k,i}\): Number of recruits for manpower \(k\) in year \(i\).
- \(\text{overmanning}_{k,i}\): Number of overmanned manpower \(k\) in year \(i\).
- \(\text{short}_{k,i}\): Number of short-time manpower \(k\) in year \(i\).
- \(\text{redundancy}_{k,i}\): Number of redundancies for manpower \(k\) in year \(i\).

This setup models the constraints and objective for the cost minimization problem given the manpower requirements, recruitment limits, and wastage rates.

\end{document}
```

This LaTeX document defines the problem by first stating the objective to minimize costs associated with redundancy, overmanning, and short-time working. It includes constraints to ensure manpower availability satisfies the required needs, accounts for natural wastage and recruitment limits, and defines all necessary decision variables. This setup is structured to fit within a typical linear programming framework and solve for the optimal staffing strategy over the given time horizon.
