PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A mining company is going to continue operating in a certain area for the next years. 
- There are \var{n_mines} mines in this area, but it can operate at most \var{n_maxwork} in any one year. 
- Although a mine may not operate in a certain year, it is still necessary to keep it ‘open’, in the sense that royalties are payable, if it be operated in a future year. 
- Clearly, if a mine is not going to be worked again, it can be permanently closed down and no more royalties need be paid. 
- The yearly royalties payable on each mine kept ‘open’ is \var{royalty_{k}} for mine \var{k}.
- There is an upper limit to the amount of ore, which can be extracted from each mine in a year. 
- The upper limit for mine \var{k} is \var{limit_{k}}.
- The ore from the different mines is of varying quality.
- This quality is measured on a scale so that blending ores together results in a linear combination of the quality measurements, for example, if equal quantities of two ores were combined, the resultant ore would have a quality measurement half way between
that of the ingredient ores. 
- The quality of ore from mine \var{k} is \var{quality_{k}}.
- In each year, it is necessary to combine the total outputs from each mine to produce a blended ore of exactly some stipulated quality.
- In year \var{i}, the required quality is \var{requiredquality_{i}}.
- The final blended ore sells for \var{price} ton each year. 
- Revenue and expenditure for future years must be discounted at a rate of \var{discount} per annum.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "n_mines": n_mines,
    "n_maxwork": n_maxwork,
    "royalty": [royalty_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "limit": [limit_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "quality": [quality_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "requiredquality": [requiredquality_{i} for i in 1,...,I],
    "price": price,
    "discount": discount
}


OBJECTIVE: To maximize profit, which mines should be operated each year and how much should they produce?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{isoperated} represents whether each mine is operated in each year
- \var{amount} represents the amount of ore produced by each mine in each year

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "isoperated": [[isoperated_{k, i} for i in 1,...,I] for k in 1,...K]
    "amount": [[amount_{k, i} for i in 1,...,I] for k in 1,...K]

To solve this problem, we need to formulate a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model that incorporates the constraints and objectives described. The objective is to maximize the profit over the given years, considering the royalties, production limits, and quality requirements.

Below is the mathematical model formulated in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Model}

\subsection*{Indices and Sets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $k \in \{1, \ldots, n\_mines\}$: Index representing each mine.
    \item $i \in \{1, \ldots, I\}$: Index representing each year.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n\_maxwork$: Maximum number of mines that can be operated in any one year.
    \item $royalty_k$: Yearly royalty cost for keeping mine $k$ open.
    \item $limit_k$: Maximum production limit for mine $k$ in any year.
    \item $quality_k$: Quality of ore from mine $k$.
    \item $requiredquality_i$: Required quality of blended ore for year $i$.
    \item $price$: Selling price per ton of final blended ore.
    \item $discount$: Discount rate for future revenues and expenses.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $isoperated_{k,i} \in \{0, 1\}$: Binary variable indicating if mine $k$ is operated in year $i$.
    \item $amount_{k,i} \geq 0$: Amount of ore produced by mine $k$ in year $i$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Maximize the discounted profit:

\[
\max \sum_{i=1}^{I} \left( \frac{1}{(1 + discount)^i} \left( price \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{n\_mines} amount_{k,i} - \sum_{k=1}^{n\_mines} royalty_k \cdot isoperated_{k,i} \right) \right)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{align}
    & \sum_{k=1}^{n\_mines} isoperated_{k,i} \leq n\_maxwork, \quad \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, I\} \quad \text{(Maximum number of mines operated per year)} \\
    & amount_{k,i} \leq limit_k \cdot isoperated_{k,i}, \quad \forall k \in \{1, \ldots, n\_mines\}, \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, I\} \quad \text{(Production limit constraint)} \\
    & \sum_{k=1}^{n\_mines} quality_k \cdot amount_{k,i} = requiredquality_i \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{n\_mines} amount_{k,i}, \quad \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, I\} \quad \text{(Quality requirement constraint)}
\end{align}

\end{document}
```

This model defines the structure to determine which mines to operate and how much ore to produce from each mine to maximize profit, while respecting all relevant constraints like production limits, quality requirements, and operational restrictions.
