PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- A manager of an oil refinery has \var{allocated_i} million barrels of crude oil type \var{i} allocated for production during the coming month. 
- These resources can be used to make \var{P} different products. product \var{p} sells for $ \var{price_p} per barrel.
- There are \var{L} production processes. Process \var{l} uses \var{input_l_i} barrels of each crude \var{i}, and produces \var{output_l_p} barrels of each product \var{p}. 
- Process \var{l} has a cost of \var{cost_l} per barrel of product produced.
- All \var{input_l_i} quantities and \var{output_l_p} quanitites are in barrels. 
- There are no separate cost items for the cost of the crudes, as they have already been allocated.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "allocated": [allocated_i for i in 1, ..., O],
    "price": [price_p for p in 1, ..., P],
    "input": [[input_l_i for i in 1, ..., O] for l in 1, ..., L],
    "output": [[output_l_p for p in 1, ..., P] for l in 1, ..., L],
    "cost": [cost_l for l in 1, ..., L]
}

OBJECTIVE: We want to know how many times should we execute each process to maximize the revenue for the next month (you can assume that the number of times that each process is executed is a floating point number)

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{revenue} is the total revenue for the month.
- \var{execute_l} is the number of times that process \var{l} should be executed.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "revenue": revenue,
    "execute": [execute_l for l in 1, ..., L]
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model the given problem as a Linear Programming (LP) problem, we need to maximize the total revenue obtained from selling the products minus the cost associated with the production processes. This involves setting up the objective function and constraints based on the input data provided.

Here's the mathematical formulation of the problem in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Model}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let \( x_l \) be the number of times process \( l \) is executed for \( l = 1, \ldots, L \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Maximize the revenue:
\[
\text{Revenue} = \sum_{p=1}^{P} \text{price}_p \left( \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{output}_{l,p} \cdot x_l \right) - \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{cost}_l \cdot \sum_{p=1}^{P} \text{output}_{l,p} \cdot x_l
\]
This can be simplified to:
\[
\max \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( \sum_{p=1}^{P} (\text{price}_p \cdot \text{output}_{l,p} - \text{cost}_l \cdot \text{output}_{l,p}) \right) x_l
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. Crude Oil Availability:
   For each crude \( i \), the consumption cannot exceed its allocation:
   \[
   \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{input}_{l,i} \cdot x_l \leq \text{allocated}_i, \quad i = 1, \ldots, O
   \]

2. Non-negativity:
   \[
   x_l \geq 0, \quad l = 1, \ldots, L
   \]

\subsection*{Summary}
The problem is to maximize the objective function subject to the above constraints. The decision variables \( x_l \) represent the number of times each process is executed, which are continuous and non-negative.

\end{document}
```

This LP formulation captures the essence of the problem where the goal is to determine the optimal number of times each production process needs to be executed to maximize the total revenue while respecting the crude oil allocation constraints.
