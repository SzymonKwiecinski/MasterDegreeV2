PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- The town has \var{S} different shifts for the police officers during the day.
- During each shift \var{s}, the town requires \var{officers_needed_{s}} police officers on duty.
- Each police officer works for two consecutive shifts.
- The cost for the town when starting a shift at \var{s} is \var{shift_cost_{s}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "officers_needed": [officers_needed_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "shift_costs": [shift_cost_{s} for s in 1, ..., S]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many officers should the town assign to each shift in order to minimize the total cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- The number of officers assigned to each shift \var{officers_assigned_{s}}.
- \var{total_cost} indicates the total cost for the town.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "officers_assigned": [officers_assigned_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

To create a linear programming model for this problem, we need to define decision variables, constraints, and an objective function in LaTeX format. The decision variable will be the number of officers starting their shift at each time, which will affect the two consecutive shifts.

Let's define the mathematical model as follows:

- Let \( x_s \) be the number of officers starting shift \( s \).
- We need to ensure that for each shift \( s \), the number of officers on duty meets the requirement.

The constraints are defined as:

- For each shift \( s \), the officers needed should be less than or equal to the sum of officers starting at this shift and those from the previous shift (since each officer works for two consecutive shifts).

The objective is to minimize the total cost of assigning officers across shifts.

The LaTeX code for the mathematical model is as follows:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Objective:}
Minimize the total cost of assigning officers to shifts.

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\( x_s \): Number of officers starting at shift \( s \).

\textbf{Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( S \): Total number of shifts.
    \item \( \text{officers\_needed}_s \): Number of officers needed at shift \( s \).
    \item \( \text{shift\_cost}_s \): Cost of starting one officer at shift \( s \).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mathematical Formulation:}

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad Z = \sum_{s=1}^{S} \text{shift\_cost}_s \cdot x_s
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}

\[
x_s + x_{s-1 \mod S} \geq \text{officers\_needed}_s, \quad \forall s = 1, \ldots, S
\]

\[
x_s \geq 0, \quad \forall s = 1, \ldots, S
\]

Here, the constraint \( x_s + x_{s-1 \mod S} \) ensures that the number of officers on shift \( s \) is the sum of those starting shift \( s \) and those who started the previous shift (in a cyclic manner, hence the modulo operation).

\end{document}
```

This model will provide the optimal number of officers to start at each shift in order to meet the required number of officers on duty while minimizing the total cost.
