PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT:

    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,

}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is max_t |a_t|. 

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "fuel_spend" contains the total fuel spent by the rocket

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "v": [v_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "a": [a_i for i in 1, ..., T],

We define the discrete-time model of the rocket's motion as follows:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t
\end{align}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(x_t\) is the position of the rocket at time \(t\),
    \item \(v_t\) is the velocity of the rocket at time \(t\),
    \item \(a_t\) is the acceleration of the rocket at time \(t\).
\end{itemize}

We are given the following initial conditions and target values:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial position: \(x_0\)
    \item Initial velocity: \(v_0\)
    \item Target position: \(x_T\)
    \item Target velocity: \(v_T\)
    \item Time horizon: \(T\)
\end{itemize}

Our objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, defined as:
\[
\text{minimize } \max_{t} |a_t|
\]

Subject to the constraints:
\begin{align}
    x_0 &= x_0 \\
    v_0 &= v_0 \\
    x_T &= x_T \\
    v_T &= v_T
\end{align}

The state equations are iteratively defined as:
\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
\end{align}

We define:
\[
\text{fuel\_spent} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

The output format should be structured as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
{
    "x": [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "v": [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "a": [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "fuel_spend": \text{fuel\_spent},
