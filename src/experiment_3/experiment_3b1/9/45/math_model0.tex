\section*{Problem Definition}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( A \): Number of different ad types
    \item \( goal_{\text{young}} \): Goal of clicks from visitors aged 18-25 (in thousands)
    \item \( goal_{\text{old}} \): Goal of clicks from visitors older than 25 (in thousands)
    \item \( goal_{\text{unique, young}} \): Goal of unique clicks from visitors aged 18-25 (in thousands)
    \item \( goal_{\text{unique, old}} \): Goal of unique clicks from visitors older than 25 (in thousands)
    \item \( young\_click_a \): Percentage of clicks from 18-25 age range for ad type \( a \)
    \item \( old\_click_a \): Percentage of clicks from older visitors for ad type \( a \)
    \item \( cost_a \): Cost per 1000 clicks for ad type \( a \)
    \item \( max\_click_a \): Maximum allowable clicks for ad type \( a \) (in thousands)
    \item \( unique\_click_a \): Estimated percentage of unique visitors for ad type \( a \)
    \item \( clicks_a \): Number of clicks purchased for ad type \( a \) (in thousands)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Objective Function}

Minimize the total cost:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \sum_{a=1}^{A} cost_a \cdot clicks_a
\]

\section*{Constraints}

1. Total clicks from visitors aged 18-25:

\[
\sum_{a=1}^{A} young\_click_a \cdot clicks_a \geq goal_{\text{young}}
\]

2. Total clicks from visitors older than 25:

\[
\sum_{a=1}^{A} old\_click_a \cdot clicks_a \geq goal_{\text{old}}
\]

3. Total unique clicks from visitors aged 18-25:

\[
\sum_{a=1}^{A} unique\_click_a \cdot clicks_a \geq goal_{\text{unique, young}}
\]

4. Total unique clicks from visitors older than 25:

\[
\sum_{a=1}^{A} unique\_click_a \cdot clicks_a \geq goal_{\text{unique, old}}
\]

5. Maximum allowable clicks for each ad type:

\[
clicks_a \leq max\_click_a \quad \forall a = 1, 2, \ldots, A
\]

6. Non-negativity constraints:

\[
clicks_a \geq 0 \quad \forall a = 1, 2, \ldots, A
\]

\section*{Conclusion}

The optimal solution will determine the values of \( clicks_a \) that minimize the total cost while satisfying all constraints.

The output will provide:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( clicks \): A list of the number of clicks purchased for each ad type.
    \item \( total\_cost \): The total cost of the ad campaign.
\end{itemize}
