\section*{Rocket Motion Optimization Model}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \) respectively. 

The discrete-time dynamics of the rocket are given by:
\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]
\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

We control the acceleration \( a_t \) at each time step, and it is assumed that the magnitude \( |a_t| \) of the acceleration is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption.

### Problem Formulation

Given:
- Initial position \( x_0 \)
- Initial velocity \( v_0 \)
- Target position \( x_T \)
- Target velocity \( v_T \)
- Total time \( T \)

We need to minimize the total fuel cost:
\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

### Constraints
The constraints based on the dynamics of motion are:
1. Initial conditions:
   \[
   x_0 \text{ and } v_0
   \]
2. Dynamics at each time step:
   \[
   x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]
   \[
   v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]
3. Final conditions:
   \[
   x_T \text{ and } v_T
   \]

### Output
The solution will provide the following:
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Let } \text{output} &= \{ \\
&\quad "x": [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T], \\
&\quad "v": [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T], \\
&\quad "a": [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T], \\
&\quad "fuel\_spend": \text{total fuel spent} \\
\}
\end{align*}
\]
