<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"benefit": [[benefit_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...,K],
	"communication": [[communication_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
	"cost": [[cost_{l, m} for m in 1,...,L] for l in 1,...,L],
}


OBJECTIVE: Where should each department be located so as to minimize overall yearly cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{islocated_{k, l}} represents whether department \var{k} is relocated at city \var{l}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "islocated": [[islocated_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...K],
}

\section*{Mathematical Model for Department Relocation}

\subsection*{Indices}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( k \): Index for departments, where \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, K \)
    \item \( l \): Index for cities, where \( l = 1, 2, \ldots, L \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{benefit}_{k, l} \): Benefit for department \( k \) from relocation at city \( l \) (in thousands of pounds)
    \item \( \text{communication}_{k, j} \): Quantity of communication between department \( k \) and department \( j \)
    \item \( \text{cost}_{l, m} \): Unit cost of communication between city \( l \) and city \( m \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{islocated}_{k, l} \): Binary variable that equals 1 if department \( k \) is located in city \( l \), and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to minimize the overall yearly cost, which can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad Z = \sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{l=1}^L \left( \sum_{j=1}^K \text{communication}_{k, j} \cdot \text{cost}_{l, m} \cdot \text{islocated}_{k, l} \right) - \sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{l=1}^L \text{benefit}_{k, l} \cdot \text{islocated}_{k, l}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Department Location Constraint:}
    \[
    \sum_{l=1}^L \text{islocated}_{k, l} = 1 \quad \forall k = 1, 2, \ldots, K
    \]
    Each department must be located in exactly one city.

    \item \textit{City Capacity Constraint:}
    \[
    \sum_{k=1}^K \text{islocated}_{k, l} \leq 3 \quad \forall l = 1, 2, \ldots, L
    \]
    No city can host more than three departments.

    \item \textit{Binary Constraints:}
    \[
    \text{islocated}_{k, l} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall k, l
    \]
