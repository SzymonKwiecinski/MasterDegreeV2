\section*{Rocket Motion Optimization Problem}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) denote the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. We define the discrete-time model as follows:

\begin{align*}
x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \\
v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t.
\end{align*}

We are given the initial conditions:
\[
x_0, \quad v_0
\]
and we need to reach the target position \( x_T \) with the target velocity \( v_T \) at time \( T \).

The objective is to minimize the total fuel consumed, represented by the total acceleration over the time steps, which we can express as follows:
\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|.
\]

The problem can be formulated with the following constraints:
\begin{align*}
x_0 & \text{ is the initial position,} \\
v_0 & \text{ is the initial velocity,} \\
x_T &= \text{target position}, \\
v_T &= \text{target velocity}.
\end{align*}

The final optimization model can be summarized in the following way:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize} \quad & \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t| \\
\text{subject to} \quad & x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T - 1,\\
& v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T - 1,\\
& x_0, v_0 \text{ as given,} \\
& x_T, v_T \text{ as desired targets.}
\end{aligned}
\]

\section*{Output Structure}

The expected output format from the optimization is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
{
    "x": [x_i for i in 0, 1, ..., T],
    "v": [v_i for i in 0, 1, ..., T],
    "a": [a_i for i in 0, 1, ..., T],
    "fuel_spend": fuel_spent,
}
\end{verbatim}
