PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A manufacturer wishes to produce \var{alloy_quant} lb of an alloy that consists of several kinds of metals.
- And by weight, the alloy we want contains a target quantity\var{target_{m}} of metal \var{metal_{m}}.
- Several other kinds of alloys are available at various prices. 
- These alloys can be melted to get the alloy we want.
- Alloy \var{k} has \var{ratio_{k, m}} ratio of \var{metal_{m}} and is sold at price of \var{price_k}.
- Ratio \var{ratio_{k, m}} ranges between 0 and 1.0 and should be properly treated in optimization

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"alloy_quant": alloy_quant,
	"target": [target_{m} for m in 1,...,M],
	"ratio": [[ratio_{k, m} for m in 1,...,M] for k = 1,...,K],
	"price": [price_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}

OBJECTIVE: The manufacturer wishes to find the amounts of the various alloys needed and to determine the cheapest combination.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{amount} represents the quantity of each alloy we buy

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"amount": [amount_{k} for k in 1,...,K]

\section*{Problem Definition}
A manufacturer wishes to produce a total of \( \text{alloy\_quant} \) lb of an alloy that contains targeted quantities of various metals. The alloy consists of several kinds of metals, and the quantity of metal \( m \) in the final alloy should meet the target weight \( \text{target}_{m} \). 

The available alloys have varying compositions and prices:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Alloy \( k \) has a ratio \( \text{ratio}_{k,m} \) of metal \( m \) and is sold at a price \( \text{price}_k \).
    \item The ratio \( \text{ratio}_{k,m} \) of each alloy is within the range [0, 1].
\end{itemize}

\section*{Decision Variables}
Let \( \text{amount}_k \) represent the quantity of alloy \( k \) purchased.

\section*{Objective Function}
The objective of the manufacturer is to minimize the total cost of the alloys purchased:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{price}_k \cdot \text{amount}_k
\]

\section*{Constraints}
1. The total amount of the produced alloy must equal the desired alloy quantity:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{amount}_k = \text{alloy\_quant}
\]

2. The amount of each metal \( m \) in the produced alloy must meet the target:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{ratio}_{k,m} \cdot \text{amount}_k = \text{target}_{m}, \quad \forall m = 1, \ldots, M
\]

3. Non-negativity constraints on the amount of each alloy:

\[
\text{amount}_k \geq 0, \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
\]

\section*{Output}
The solution will provide the quantities of each alloy to be purchased:

\[
\text{Output: } \text{"amount": } [ \text{amount}_k \text{ for } k = 1, \ldots, K ]
\]

    \item The ratio \( \text{ratio}_{k,m} \) of each alloy is within the range [0, 1].
\end{itemize}

\section*{Decision Variables}
Let \( \text{amount}_k \) represent the quantity of alloy \( k \) purchased.

\section*{Objective Function}
The objective of the manufacturer is to minimize the total cost of the alloys purchased:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{price}_k \cdot \text{amount}_k
\]

\section*{Constraints}
1. The total amount of the produced alloy must equal the desired alloy quantity:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{amount}_k = \text{alloy\_quant}
\]

2. The amount of each metal \( m \) in the produced alloy must meet the target:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{ratio}_{k,m} \cdot \text{amount}_k = \text{target}_{m}, \quad \forall m = 1, \ldots, M
\]

3. Non-negativity constraints on the amount of each alloy:

\[
\text{amount}_k \geq 0, \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
\]

\section*{Output}
The solution will provide the quantities of each alloy to be purchased:

\[
\text{Output: } \text{"amount": } [ \text{amount}_k \text{ for } k = 1, \ldots, K ]
\]
