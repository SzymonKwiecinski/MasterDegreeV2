\section*{Problem Definition}
We define the following variables and parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( P \) be the number of power plants.
    \item Let \( C \) be the number of cities.
    \item Let \( supply_{p} \) be the capacity of power plant \( p \) (in million kWh).
    \item Let \( demand_{c} \) be the peak demand of city \( c \) (in million kWh).
    \item Let \( transmission_{p,c} \) be the transmission cost from power plant \( p \) to city \( c \) (in \$/million kWh).
    \item Let \( send_{p,c} \) be the amount of electricity sent from power plant \( p \) to city \( c \) (in million kWh).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Objective Function}
We aim to minimize the total transmission cost:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{p=1}^{P} \sum_{c=1}^{C} transmission_{p,c} \cdot send_{p,c}
\]

\section*{Constraints}

1. Supply Constraints:
\[
\sum_{c=1}^{C} send_{p,c} \leq supply_{p}, \quad \forall p = 1, 2, \ldots, P
\]

2. Demand Constraints:
\[
\sum_{p=1}^{P} send_{p,c} = demand_{c}, \quad \forall c = 1, 2, \ldots, C
\]

3. Non-negativity Constraints:
\[
send_{p,c} \geq 0, \quad \forall p = 1, 2, \ldots, P, \quad \forall c = 1, 2, \ldots, C
\]

\section*{Output}
The output will consist of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The amount of electricity each power plant sends to each city represented as \( send_{p,c} \) (in million kWh).
    \item The total transmission cost represented as \( total\_cost \).
\end{itemize}
