\section*{Mathematical Model}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let \( islocated_{k,l} \) be a binary variable defined as follows:
\[
islocated_{k,l} =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if department } k \text{ is located at city } l \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( K \): Number of departments
    \item \( L \): Number of cities
    \item \( benefit_{k,l} \): Benefit derived by department \( k \) from relocation at city \( l \) (in thousands of pounds)
    \item \( communication_{k,j} \): Quantity of communication between department \( k \) and department \( j \)
    \item \( cost_{l,m} \): Unit cost of communication between city \( l \) and city \( m \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the overall yearly cost, which is defined as:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( \sum_{m=1}^{L} communication_{k,j} \cdot cost_{l,m} \cdot islocated_{k,l} \right) - \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} benefit_{k,l} \cdot islocated_{k,l}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. Each department can only be located in one city:
\[
\sum_{l=1}^{L} islocated_{k,l} = 1 \quad \forall k \in \{1, \ldots, K\}
\]

2. No city can accommodate more than three departments:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} islocated_{k,l} \leq 3 \quad \forall l \in \{1, \ldots, L\}
\]

3. Binary constraints on location decision variables:
\[
islocated_{k,l} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall k \in \{1, \ldots, K\}, \, l \in \{1, \ldots, L\}
\]
