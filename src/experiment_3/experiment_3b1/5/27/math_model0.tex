\section*{Mathematical Model for Department Relocation Problem}

\subsection*{Sets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( K \) be the set of departments, indexed by \( k \).
    \item Let \( L \) be the set of possible cities, indexed by \( l \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( benefit_{k, l} \): benefits (in thousands of pounds) for department \( k \) from relocation at city \( l \).
    \item \( communication_{k, j} \): quantity of communication between department \( k \) and city \( j \).
    \item \( cost_{l, m} \): unit cost of communication between city \( l \) and city \( m \).
    \item \( C \): maximum number of departments that can be located in any city (e.g., \( C = 3 \)).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( islocated_{k, l} \): 
    \[
    islocated_{k, l} = 
    \begin{cases} 
    1 & \text{if department } k \text{ is located in city } l \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the overall yearly cost, defined as:
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad Z = \sum_{k \in K} \sum_{l \in L} islocated_{k, l} \left( \sum_{j \in K} communication_{k, j} \cdot cost_{l, j} - benefit_{k, l} \right)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each department must be located in one city:
    \[
    \sum_{l \in L} islocated_{k, l} = 1 \quad \forall k \in K
    \]
    
    \item No more than \( C \) departments can be located in any city:
    \[
    \sum_{k \in K} islocated_{k, l} \leq C \quad \forall l \in L
    \]
    
    \item Binary condition for decision variables:
    \[
    islocated_{k, l} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall k \in K, \forall l \in L
    \]
\end{itemize}
