PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A quantity y is known to depend on another quantity x. A set of corresponding values has been collected for x and y and is presented.
- The \var{k}-th y value takes \var{y_{k}} and the \var{k}-th x value takes \var{x_{k}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "y": [y_{k} for k = 1,...,K],
    "x": [x_{k} for k = 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Fit the ‘best’ straight line y = bx + a to this set of data points. The objective is to minimise the sum of absolute deviations of each observed value of y from the value predicted by the linear relationship.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{intercept} represents the intercept of the fitted line
- \var{slope} represents the slope of the fitted line

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Linear Regression}

We are given a set of corresponding values for \( x \) and \( y \) as follows:

\[
y = [y_{1}, y_{2}, \ldots, y_{K}]
\]
\[
x = [x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{K}]
\]

We want to fit the best straight line of the form:

\[
y = bx + a
\]

Where:
- \( b \) is the slope,
- \( a \) is the intercept.

The objective is to minimize the sum of absolute deviations between the observed values \( y_k \) and the predicted values \( bx_k + a \):

\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{k=1}^{K} |y_k - (bx_k + a)|
\]

To formulate this as a linear programming problem, we introduce auxiliary variables \( d_k \) for each \( k \) to represent the absolute deviations. Thus, we can rewrite the objective function as:

\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{k=1}^{K} d_k
\]

Subject to the constraints:

\[
y_k - (bx_k + a) \leq d_k \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
\]
\[
-(y_k - (bx_k + a)) \leq d_k \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
\]

This linear programming model allows us to determine the values of \( a \) (intercept) and \( b \) (slope) that minimize the sum of absolute deviations.
