PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Consider the problem of operating a warehouse, by buying and selling the stock of a certain commodity, in order to maximize profit over a certain length of time, say several periods.
- The warehouse has a fixed capacity \var{capacity}, and there is a cost \var{holding_cost} per unit for holding stock for one period.
- The selling price, \var{price_{n}}$, of the commodity is known to fluctuate over a number of time periods. 
- In any period \var{n} the price holding for purchase is \var{cost_{n}}.
- The warehouse is originally empty and is required to be empty at the end of the last period.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"holding_cost": holding_cost,
	"price", [price_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"cost": [cost_{n} for n in 1,...,N]
}


OBJECTIVE: Determine the amount of buying and selling in each period to maximize the profit over the months

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{buyquantity} represents the amount of buying in each period
- \var{sellquantity} represents the amount of selling in each period
- \var{stock} represents the stock in each period, excluding the intial stock

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"buyquantity": [buyquantity_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"sellquantity": [sellquantity_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"stock": [stock_{n} for n in 1,...,N]
}

\section*{Problem Definition}

We aim to maximize the profit of operating a warehouse by purchasing and selling a certain commodity over multiple periods. The warehouse has a fixed capacity and incurs holding costs for the stock.

\subsection*{Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $C$: Capacity of the warehouse
    \item $h$: Holding cost per unit for one period
    \item $p_n$: Selling price of the commodity in period $n$, for $n = 1, \ldots, N$
    \item $c_n$: Purchase cost of the commodity in period $n$, for $n = 1, \ldots, N$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Variables}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $b_n$: Amount of buying in period $n$, for $n = 1, \ldots, N$
    \item $s_n$: Amount of selling in period $n$, for $n = 1, \ldots, N$
    \item $x_n$: Stock in period $n$, for $n = 1, \ldots, N$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}

The objective is to maximize total profit over the periods, which can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( p_n \cdot s_n - c_n \cdot b_n - h \cdot x_n \right)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. **Stock Balance Constraint**:
   \[
   x_n = x_{n-1} + b_n - s_n \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}
   \]
   
2. **Capacity Constraint**:
   \[
   x_n \leq C \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}
   \]

3. **Non-negativity Constraints**:
   \[
   b_n \geq 0, \quad s_n \geq 0, \quad x_n \geq 0 \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}
   \]

4. **Initial and Final Stock Condition**:
   \[
   x_0 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad x_N = 0
   \]

\subsection*{Output}

The solution will provide the following quantities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $b_n$: Amount of buying in each period
    \item $s_n$: Amount of selling in each period
    \item $x_n$: Stock in each period
\end{itemize}
