PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

\section*{Mathematical Model for Rocket Trajectory Control}

\subsection*{Variables}
Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_t \): Position of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( v_t \): Velocity of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( a_t \): Acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Discretized Model}
The dynamics of the rocket can be represented using the following equations:
\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]
\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is represented as:
\[
\min \max_t |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial position and velocity: \( x_0, v_0 \)
    \item Target position and velocity: \( x_T, v_T \)
    \item Total time: \( T \)
\end{itemize}

The model must satisfy the following conditions:
\[
x_T = x_T \quad \text{(target position)}
\]
\[
v_T = v_T \quad \text{(target velocity)}
\]

The fuel consumption at each time step is proportional to the acceleration:
\[
\text{Fuel Spent} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Inputs}
The input format is:
\[
\{ 
    x_0, 
    v_0, 
    x_T, 
    v_T, 
    T 
\}
\]

\subsection*{Outputs}
The outputs required are:
\[
\{ 
    x = [x_i \, \forall i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T\}], 
    v = [v_i \, \forall i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T\}], 
    a = [a_i \, \forall i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T\}], 
    \text{fuel\_spend} = \text{Total fuel spent}
