\section*{Rocket Trajectory Optimal Control Problem}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) denote the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The dynamics of the rocket can be modeled using the following discrete-time equations:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t.
\end{align}

Given the initial conditions \( x_0 \) and \( v_0 \), the goal is to reach a target position \( x_T \) with a target speed \( v_T \) at time \( T \), while minimizing the total fuel consumption, represented by the acceleration \( a_t \).

\subsection*{Inputs}

The problem takes the following input parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial position: \( x_0 \)
    \item Initial velocity: \( v_0 \)
    \item Target position: \( x_T \)
    \item Target velocity: \( v_T \)
    \item Time horizon: \( T \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}

The objective is to minimize the total fuel spent, defined as follows:

\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

The model is subject to the following constraints:

\begin{align}
    x_{T} &= x_T, \\
    v_{T} &= v_T, \\
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \quad \forall t \in [0, T-1], \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t, \quad \forall t \in [0, T-1].
\end{align}

Thus, the complete optimization problem can be formulated as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\text{Minimize} & \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t| \\
\text{subject to} & x_{0} = x_0, \\
                  & v_{0} = v_0, \\
                  & x_{T} = x_T, \\
                  & v_{T} = v_T, \\
                  & x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t, \quad \forall t \in [0, T-1], \\
                  & v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t, \quad \forall t \in [0, T-1].
\end{array}
\]

\subsection*{Outputs}

The solution provides the following outputs:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x \): List of positions of the rocket at each time step from \( 0 \) to \( T \).
    \item \( v \): List of velocities of the rocket at each time step from \( 0 \) to \( T \).
    \item \( a \): List of accelerations of the rocket at each time step from \( 0 \) to \( T \).
    \item \( \text{fuel\_spend} \): Total fuel spent by the rocket.
\end{itemize}
