PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A quantity y is known to depend on another quantity x. A set of corresponding values has been collected for x and y and is presented.
- The \var{k}-th y value takes \var{y_{k}} and the \var{k}-th x value takes \var{x_{k}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "y": [y_{k} for k = 1,...,K],
    "x": [x_{k} for k = 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Fit the ‘best’ straight line y = bx + a where the objective is to minimize the maximum deviation of all the observed values of y from the value predicted by the linear relationship.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{intercept} represents the intercept of the fitted line
- \var{slope} represents the slope of the fitted line

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Best Fit Line}

Let us denote the observed values of \( y \) and \( x \) as follows:

\[
y = \{ y_{1}, y_{2}, \ldots, y_{K} \} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \{ x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{K} \}
\]

We aim to fit the best straight line of the form:

\[
y = bx + a
\]

where \( b \) is the slope and \( a \) is the intercept.

The objective is to minimize the maximum deviation between the observed values of \( y \) and the predictions of the linear model. We will define the deviations as follows:

\[
d_{k} = y_{k} - (bx_{k} + a) \quad \text{for } k = 1, 2, \ldots, K
\]

To transform this into a linear programming problem, we introduce a new variable \( D \) to represent the maximum deviation:

\[
D \geq d_{k} \quad \text{for all } k = 1, 2, \ldots, K
\]
\[
D \geq -d_{k} \quad \text{for all } k = 1, 2, \ldots, K
\]

Thus, we can reformulate the constraints as:

\[
D \geq y_{k} - (bx_{k} + a) \quad \text{for } k = 1, 2, \ldots, K
\]
\[
D \geq -(y_{k} - (bx_{k} + a)) \quad \text{for } k = 1, 2, \ldots, K
\]

Now, the objective function can be formally stated as:

\[
\text{Minimize } D
\]

The complete linear programming formulation is as follows:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize} \quad & D \\
\text{subject to} \quad & y_{k} - (bx_{k} + a) \leq D, \quad k = 1, 2, \ldots, K \\
& -(y_{k} - (bx_{k} + a)) \leq D, \quad k = 1, 2, \ldots, K \\
& b, a \text{ are unrestricted}
\end{align*}
\]

The solution to this linear programming model will yield the values of \( a \) (intercept) and \( b \) (slope) that minimize the maximum deviation from the fitted line.
