PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

\section*{Mathematical Model for Rocket Trajectory Optimization}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The discrete-time dynamics of the rocket can be expressed as follows:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t
\end{align}

Given the problem parameters:
- Initial position: \( x_0 \)
- Initial velocity: \( v_0 \)
- Target position: \( x_T \)
- Target velocity: \( v_T \)
- Time horizon: \( T \)

The goal is to minimize the maximum thrust required, denoted as \( \max_t |a_t| \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to minimize the maximum absolute acceleration:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \max_{t=0, \ldots, T} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
The evolution of the rocket's state can be constrained as follows:
1. For each time step \( t \) from \( 0 \) to \( T-1 \):
   \begin{align}
       x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \\
       v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t
   \end{align}
   
2. At the final time step \( T \):
   \begin{align}
       x_T &= x_T \\
       v_T &= v_T
   \end{align}

3. The thrust constraints can be modeled as:
   \[
   -Z \leq a_t \leq Z, \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T
   \]

\subsection*{Output Variables}
The output variables are defined as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{"x"}: [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T] \)
    \item \( \text{"v"}: [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T] \)
    \item \( \text{"a"}: [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T] \)
    \item \( \text{"fuel\_spend"}: \text{total fuel spent} \)
\end{itemize}
