\section*{Linear Programming Model to Fit a Line}

Given the data points \((x_k, y_k)\) for \(k = 1, \ldots, K\), we aim to find the best fit line \(y = bx + a\) by minimizing the sum of absolute deviations. The objective is formulated as follows:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{k=1}^{K} |y_k - (bx_k + a)|
\]

To handle the absolute values, we introduce non-negative variables \(u_k\) for \(k = 1, \ldots, K\) such that:

\[
u_k \geq y_k - (bx_k + a) \quad \text{and} \quad u_k \geq -(y_k - (bx_k + a))
\]

This leads to the following linear constraints:

1. \( y_k - bx_k - a \leq u_k \) for all \( k = 1, \ldots, K \)
2. \( -y_k + bx_k + a \leq u_k \) for all \( k = 1, \ldots, K \)

We can rewrite the optimization problem as:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{k=1}^{K} u_k
\]

Subject to the constraints:

\[
\begin{align*}
y_k - bx_k - a & \leq u_k, \quad k = 1, \ldots, K \\
-y_k + bx_k + a & \leq u_k, \quad k = 1, \ldots, K \\
u_k & \geq 0, \quad k = 1, \ldots, K
\end{align*}
\]

Additionally, we include the constraints for \(b\) and \(a\) to be determined.

The solution of this linear program will yield the values of the intercept \(a\) and the slope \(b\) of the fitted line.

\textbf{Output:}

\[
\{
\text{"intercept"}: a,
\text{"slope"}: b
\}
\]
