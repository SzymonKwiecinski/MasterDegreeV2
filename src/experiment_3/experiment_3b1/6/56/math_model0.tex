\section*{Optimization Model for Delivery Person's Path}

\subsection*{Problem Description}
The delivery person must navigate a grid between intersections, moving only north or west, with each block having a unique walking time due to pedestrian traffic. The goal is to minimize the total delivery time.

\subsection*{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( N \) be the total number of streets (north-south).
    \item Let \( W \) be the total number of avenues (east-west).
    \item Let \( west\_time_{n,w} \) be the time to move from the intersection of \( w \)th Avenue and \( n \)th Street to \( (w+1) \)th Avenue and \( n \)th Street.
    \item Let \( north\_time_{n,w} \) be the time to move from the intersection of \( w \)th Avenue and \( n \)th Street to \( w \)th Avenue and \( (n+1) \)th Street.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Variables}
Define the binary decision variables:
\[
x_{n,w} =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if the delivery person moves north from } (w, n) \text{ to } (w, n+1) \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
\[
y_{n,w} =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if the delivery person moves west from } (w, n) \text{ to } (w+1, n) \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total travel time:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W} north\_time_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w} + \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} west\_time_{n,w} \cdot y_{n,w}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. **Flow Constraints:**
   - At each intersection, the delivery person can only move north or west:
   \[
   \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} y_{n,w} + \sum_{w=1}^{W} x_{n,w} = 1, \quad \forall n
   \]
   - The delivery person must reach the final destination at \( (W, N) \).

2. **Non-negativity Constraints:**
   \[
   x_{n,w} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad y_{n,w} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall n, w
   \]

\subsection*{Output}
The output will consist of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The paths taken by the delivery person, represented as \( (street_n, avenue_w) \) for \( id = 1, \ldots, m \).
    \item The total travel time \( total\_time \) computed from the objective function.
\end{itemize}
