\section*{Mathematical Model for Department Relocation}

\subsection*{Indices}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $k$: index for departments, $k = 1, 2, \ldots, K$
    \item $l$: index for cities, $l = 1, 2, \ldots, L$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $benefit_{k, l}$: benefits for department $k$ from relocation at city $l$ (in thousands of pounds)
    \item $communication_{k, j}$: quantity of communication between department $k$ and department $j$
    \item $cost_{l, m}$: unit cost of communication between city $l$ and city $m$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $islocated_{k, l}$: binary variable which is 1 if department $k$ is located at city $l$, and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the overall yearly cost:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( \sum_{j=1}^{K} communication_{k, j} \cdot cost_{l, m} \right) \cdot islocated_{k, l} - \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} benefit_{k, l} \cdot islocated_{k, l}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. Each department is located in one city: 

\[
\sum_{l=1}^{L} islocated_{k, l} = 1, \quad \forall k = 1, 2, \ldots, K
\]

2. No city can host more than three departments:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} islocated_{k, l} \leq 3, \quad \forall l = 1, 2, \ldots, L
\]

3. Binary constraints on the location variables:

\[
islocated_{k, l} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall k = 1, 2, \ldots, K, \quad \forall l = 1, 2, \ldots, L
\]
