\section*{Rocket Motion Optimization Model}

Given the discrete-time model for the rocket's motion:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t,
\end{align}

where \(x_t\), \(v_t\), and \(a_t\) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \(t\), respectively, we wish to optimize the rocket's flight to reach a target position and velocity at a specified time.

\subsection*{Parameters}
Let the inputs be defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(x_0\): Initial position of the rocket
    \item \(v_0\): Initial velocity of the rocket
    \item \(x_T\): Target position
    \item \(v_T\): Target velocity
    \item \(T\): Time at which the targets are to be achieved
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective}
We aim to minimize the maximum thrust required during the rocket's flight, represented mathematically as:

\[
\text{Minimize } \max_t |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
The position and velocity must satisfy the following constraints at each time step \(t\):

\begin{align}
    x_0 &= x_0, \\
    v_0 &= v_0, \\
    x_{T} &= x_T, \\
    v_{T} &= v_T.
\end{align}

Additionally, the relationship between subsequent states is given by the equations of motion:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \dots, T-1, \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \dots, T-1.
\end{align}

\subsection*{Output}
The solution to the optimization problem will yield:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A list of positions: \(\{x_i\}_{i=0}^{T}\)
    \item A list of velocities: \(\{v_i\}_{i=0}^{T}\)
    \item A list of accelerations: \(\{a_i\}_{i=0}^{T}\)
    \item Total fuel spent: \(fuel\_spent\)
\end{itemize}

The output format will be:

\[
\{
    "x": [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "v": [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "a": [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "fuel\_spend": fuel\_spent,
\}
\]
