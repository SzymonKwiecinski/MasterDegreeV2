PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is max_t |a_t|.

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}

\section*{Rocket Motion Optimization Model}

Given the discrete-time model for the rocket's motion:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t,
\end{align}

where \(x_t\), \(v_t\), and \(a_t\) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \(t\), respectively, we wish to optimize the rocket's flight to reach a target position and velocity at a specified time.

\subsection*{Parameters}
Let the inputs be defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(x_0\): Initial position of the rocket
    \item \(v_0\): Initial velocity of the rocket
    \item \(x_T\): Target position
    \item \(v_T\): Target velocity
    \item \(T\): Time at which the targets are to be achieved
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective}
We aim to minimize the maximum thrust required during the rocket's flight, represented mathematically as:

\[
\text{Minimize } \max_t |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
The position and velocity must satisfy the following constraints at each time step \(t\):

\begin{align}
    x_0 &= x_0, \\
    v_0 &= v_0, \\
    x_{T} &= x_T, \\
    v_{T} &= v_T.
\end{align}

Additionally, the relationship between subsequent states is given by the equations of motion:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \dots, T-1, \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \dots, T-1.
\end{align}

\subsection*{Output}
The solution to the optimization problem will yield:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A list of positions: \(\{x_i\}_{i=0}^{T}\)
    \item A list of velocities: \(\{v_i\}_{i=0}^{T}\)
    \item A list of accelerations: \(\{a_i\}_{i=0}^{T}\)
    \item Total fuel spent: \(fuel\_spent\)
\end{itemize}

The output format will be:

\[
\{
    "x": [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "v": [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "a": [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "fuel\_spend": fuel\_spent,
\}
