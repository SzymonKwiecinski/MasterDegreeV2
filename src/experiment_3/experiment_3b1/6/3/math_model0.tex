\section*{Linear Programming Model for Electricity Capacity Expansion}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T$: Number of years
    \item $demand_t$: Demand for electricity during year $t$ (in megawatts)
    \item $oil_t$: Existing oil-fired capacity available during year $t$
    \item $coal\_cost$: Capital cost per megawatt of coal-fired capacity
    \item $nuke\_cost$: Capital cost per megawatt of nuclear power capacity
    \item $max\_nuke$: Maximum percentage of total capacity allowed to be nuclear (from 0 to 100)
    \item $coal\_life$: Lifespan of coal plants (in years)
    \item $nuke\_life$: Lifespan of nuclear plants (in years)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $coal_t$: Coal capacity added in year $t$ (in megawatts)
    \item $nuke_t$: Nuclear capacity added in year $t$ (in megawatts)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to minimize the total cost of capacity expansion:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{t=1}^{T} (coal\_cost \cdot coal_t + nuke\_cost \cdot nuke_t)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. The total capacity in year $t$ must meet the demand:
\[
oil_t + \sum_{j=0}^{\min(t-1, coal\_life-1)} coal_{t-j} + \sum_{j=0}^{\min(t-1, nuke\_life-1)} nuke_{t-j} \geq demand_t \quad \forall t = 1, \ldots, T
\]

2. The proportion of nuclear capacity must not exceed the specified maximum percentage:
\[
\frac{\sum_{j=0}^{\min(t-1, nuke\_life-1)} nuke_{t-j}}{oil_t + \sum_{j=0}^{\min(t-1, coal\_life-1)} coal_{t-j} + \sum_{j=0}^{\min(t-1, nuke\_life-1)} nuke_{t-j}} \leq \frac{max\_nuke}{100} \quad \forall t = 1, \ldots, T
\]

3. Non-negativity constraints:
\[
coal_t \geq 0, \quad nuke_t \geq 0 \quad \forall t = 1, \ldots, T
\]

\subsection*{Output}
The solution will provide the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{coal\_cap\_added}: List of coal capacity added in each year.
    \item \texttt{nuke\_cap\_added}: List of nuclear capacity added in each year.
    \item \texttt{total\_cost}: Total cost of the system as a floating point number.
\end{itemize}
