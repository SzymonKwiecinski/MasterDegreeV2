\section*{Mathematical Model for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)}

\subsection*{Sets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N$: The number of towns to visit.
    \item $C = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, N\}$: The set of cities, where $0$ represents the \texttt{start\_city} and cities $1$ to $N$ represent all towns.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $d_{i,j}$: The distance between city $i$ and city $j$.
    \item $start\_city$: The starting city of the traveler, denoted by $0$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{i,j}$: Binary variable, where $x_{i,j} = 1$ if the traveler visits city $j$ immediately after city $i$, and $0$ otherwise.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total distance traveled:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{i \in C} \sum_{j \in C} d_{i,j} x_{i,j}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each city (except the starting city) is visited exactly once:
    \[
    \sum_{j \in C} x_{0,j} = 1 \quad \text{(departure from start city)}
    \]
    \[
    \sum_{j \in C} x_{i,j} = 1 \quad \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, N\} \quad \text{(exactly one departure from each town)}
    \]
    \item Each city (except the starting city) is entered exactly once:
    \[
    \sum_{i \in C} x_{i,j} = 1 \quad \forall j \in \{1, \ldots, N\} \quad \text{(exactly one arrival to each town)}
    \]
    \item Subtour elimination constraints (Miller-Tucker-Zemlin formulation):
      To prevent subtours, we introduce auxiliary variables $u_i$:
    \[
    u_i - u_j + N x_{i,j} \leq N-1 \quad \forall i,j \in \{1, \ldots, N\}, i \neq j
    \]
    \item Non-negativity and binary conditions:
    \[
    x_{i,j} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall i,j \in C
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Output Information}
The sequence of cities visited after \texttt{start\_city} is denoted by \texttt{visit\_order}, and the total distance traveled is given as \texttt{total\_distance}.
