PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A traveler based in \var{start_city} needs to visit \var{N} towns for business.
- The distance \var{distance_{i,j}} between city \var{i} and \var{j} is provided in miles and are symmetric, meaning the distance from city \var{i} to city \var{j} is the same as from city \var{j} to city \var{i}.
- The traveler must return to \var{start_city} after visiting all towns.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "distances": {
        city_i: {
            city_j: distance_{i, j},
            for j in 1, ..., N-1
        },
        for i in 1, ..., N
    },
    "start_city": start_city
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the shortest route that the traveler can take to visit all \var{N} towns and return to \var{start_city}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- The sequence of cities visited after \var{start_city} is \var{visit_order}.
- \var{total_distance} traveled on this optimal journey.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "visit_order": [city_n for n in 1, ..., N+1],
    "total_distance": total_distance
}

\section*{Mathematical Model for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)}

\subsection*{Sets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N$: The number of towns to visit.
    \item $C = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, N\}$: The set of cities, where $0$ represents the \texttt{start\_city} and cities $1$ to $N$ represent all towns.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $d_{i,j}$: The distance between city $i$ and city $j$.
    \item $start\_city$: The starting city of the traveler, denoted by $0$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{i,j}$: Binary variable, where $x_{i,j} = 1$ if the traveler visits city $j$ immediately after city $i$, and $0$ otherwise.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total distance traveled:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{i \in C} \sum_{j \in C} d_{i,j} x_{i,j}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each city (except the starting city) is visited exactly once:
    \[
    \sum_{j \in C} x_{0,j} = 1 \quad \text{(departure from start city)}
    \]
    \[
    \sum_{j \in C} x_{i,j} = 1 \quad \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, N\} \quad \text{(exactly one departure from each town)}
    \]
    \item Each city (except the starting city) is entered exactly once:
    \[
    \sum_{i \in C} x_{i,j} = 1 \quad \forall j \in \{1, \ldots, N\} \quad \text{(exactly one arrival to each town)}
    \]
    \item Subtour elimination constraints (Miller-Tucker-Zemlin formulation):
      To prevent subtours, we introduce auxiliary variables $u_i$:
    \[
    u_i - u_j + N x_{i,j} \leq N-1 \quad \forall i,j \in \{1, \ldots, N\}, i \neq j
    \]
    \item Non-negativity and binary conditions:
    \[
    x_{i,j} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall i,j \in C
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Output Information}
The sequence of cities visited after \texttt{start\_city} is denoted by \texttt{visit\_order}, and the total distance traveled is given as \texttt{total\_distance}.

```

######### Key Changes Made:
1. Corrected the range for `C` from `range(N + 1)` to `range(N)` since the indices for the cities should be from `0` to `N-1`.
2. Adjusted the ranges in the loops to strictly go from `1` to `N`, making it consistent with the correct indices.
3. Updated the objective function to ensure that we only sum over valid pairs `(i, j)` where `i` is not equal to `j`.

Now the code should work correctly without any index errors.
