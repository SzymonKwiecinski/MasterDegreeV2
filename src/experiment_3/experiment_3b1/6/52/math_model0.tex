\section*{Mathematical Model for Electricity Transmission Problem}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P$: Number of power plants.
    \item $C$: Number of cities.
    \item $supply_{p}$: Capacity of power plant $p$ (in million kWh).
    \item $demand_{c}$: Peak demand of city $c$ (in million kWh).
    \item $transmission_{p,c}$: Transmission cost from power plant $p$ to city $c$ (in $/million kWh).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let $send_{p,c}$ be the amount of electricity sent from power plant $p$ to city $c$ (in million kWh).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to minimize the total transmission cost:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{p=1}^{P} \sum_{c=1}^{C} transmission_{p,c} \cdot send_{p,c}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Supply Constraints: The total amount sent from each power plant cannot exceed its capacity:
    \[
    \sum_{c=1}^{C} send_{p,c} \leq supply_{p} \quad \forall p \in \{1, \ldots, P\}
    \]
    
    \item Demand Constraints: The total amount received by each city must meet its peak demand:
    \[
    \sum_{p=1}^{P} send_{p,c} \geq demand_{c} \quad \forall c \in \{1, \ldots, C\}
    \]
    
    \item Non-negativity Constraints: The amount of electricity sent must be non-negative:
    \[
    send_{p,c} \geq 0 \quad \forall p \in \{1, \ldots, P\}, \forall c \in \{1, \ldots, C\}
    \]
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Output}
The solution to the model includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $send_{p,c}$: The amount of electricity power plant $p$ sends to city $c$.
    \item $total\_cost$: The total transmission cost for the utility.
\end{itemize}
