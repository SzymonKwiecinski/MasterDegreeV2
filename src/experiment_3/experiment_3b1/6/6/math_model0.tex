\section*{Rocket Trajectory Optimization Problem}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) be the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The dynamic model of the rocket can be described by the following equations:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t
\end{align}

We assume that the acceleration \( a_t \) is under our control, and its magnitude \( |a_t| \) is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \( t \).

Given the initial conditions \( x_0 \) and \( v_0 \), we aim to reach a target position \( x_T \) with speed \( v_T \) at time \( T \).

\subsection*{Objective}
Our objective is to minimize the total fuel spent, which can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
The optimization problem is subject to the following constraints:

\begin{align}
    x_0 &= \text{given initial position} \\
    v_0 &= \text{given initial velocity} \\
    x_T &= \text{target position at time } T \\
    v_T &= \text{target velocity at time } T \\
    t & = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, T-1
\end{align}

At each time step \( t \), we have the relationship for the position and velocity as stated previously.

\subsection*{Output}
The output of the optimization problem will contain the following elements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x \): A list of positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( v \): A list of velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( a \): A list of accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( \text{fuel\_spend} \): Total fuel spent by the rocket
\end{itemize}

The output format will be as follows:

\[
\text{Output} = \{
    "x": [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "v": [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "a": [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "fuel\_spend": \text{total fuel spent}
\}
\]
