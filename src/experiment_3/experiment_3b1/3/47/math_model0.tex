\section*{Problem Formulation}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( S \) be the number of different shifts,
    \item \( officers\_needed_s \) be the number of officers needed during shift \( s \),
    \item \( shift\_cost_s \) be the cost incurred by starting a shift \( s \),
    \item \( officers\_assigned_s \) be the number of officers assigned to shift \( s \).
\end{itemize}

The objective is to minimize the total cost for the town associated with scheduling police shifts while ensuring that the required number of officers are on duty during each shift.

\section*{Formulation}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The total cost can be represented as:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \sum_{s=1}^{S} shift\_cost_s \cdot \left(\frac{officers\_assigned_s + officers\_assigned_{s-1}}{2}\right)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
The main constraints to satisfy the required number of officers for each shift are:
\[
officers\_assigned_s = officers\_needed_s, \quad \forall s = 1, \ldots, S
\]
where \( officers\_assigned_0 = 0 \) for appropriate indexing.

Additionally, since each officer works for two consecutive shifts, the assignment should adhere to:
\[
officers\_assigned_s = officers\_assigned_{s+1}, \quad \forall s = 1, \ldots, S-1
\]

\subsection*{Model}
We can summarize the Linear Programming (LP) model as follows:

\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize:} & \quad \sum_{s=1}^{S} shift\_cost_s \cdot officers\_assigned_s \\
\text{Subject to:} & \\
& officers\_assigned_s \geq officers\_needed_s, \quad \forall s = 1, \ldots, S \\
& officers\_assigned_s = officers\_assigned_{s+1}, \quad \forall s = 1, \ldots, S-1 \\
& officers\_assigned_s \geq 0 \quad \forall s = 1, \ldots, S
\end{align*}

\section*{Output}
The output includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( officers\_assigned = [officers\_assigned_s \text{ for } s = 1, \ldots, S] \)
    \item \( total\_cost \) which represents the total cost incurred for the shifts.
\end{itemize}
