<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A mining company is going to continue operating in a certain area for the next years. 
- There are \var{n_mines} mines in this area, but it can operate at most \var{n_maxwork} in any one year. 
- Although a mine may not operate in a certain year, it is still necessary to keep it ‘open’, in the sense that royalties are payable, if it be operated in a future year. 
- Clearly, if a mine is not going to be worked again, it can be permanently closed down and no more royalties need be paid. 
- The yearly royalties payable on each mine kept ‘open’ is \var{royalty_{k}} for mine \var{k}.
- There is an upper limit to the amount of ore, which can be extracted from each mine in a year. 
- The upper limit for mine \var{k} is \var{limit_{k}}.
- The ore from the different mines is of varying quality.
- This quality is measured on a scale so that blending ores together results in a linear combination of the quality measurements, for example, if equal quantities of two ores were combined, the resultant ore would have a quality measurement half way between
that of the ingredient ores. 
- The quality of ore from mine \var{k} is \var{quality_{k}}.
- In each year, it is necessary to combine the total outputs from each mine to produce a blended ore of exactly some stipulated quality.
- In year \var{i}, the required quality is \var{requiredquality_{i}}.
- The final blended ore sells for \var{price} ton each year. 
- Revenue and expenditure for future years must be discounted at a rate of \var{discount} per annum.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "n_mines": n_mines,
    "n_maxwork": n_maxwork,
    "royalty": [royalty_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "limit": [limit_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "quality": [quality_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "requiredquality": [requiredquality_{i} for i in 1,...,I],
    "price": price,
    "discount": discount
}


OBJECTIVE: To maximize profit, which mines should be operated each year and how much should they produce?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{isoperated} represents whether each mine is operated in each year
- \var{amount} represents the amount of ore produced by each mine in each year

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "isoperated": [[isoperated_{k, i} for i in 1,...,I] for k in 1,...K]
    "amount": [[amount_{k, i} for i in 1,...,I] for k in 1,...K]
