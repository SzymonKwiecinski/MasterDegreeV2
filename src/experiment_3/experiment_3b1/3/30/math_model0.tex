\section*{Quadratic Curve Fitting Problem}

Given a set of observed values \( y_k \) corresponding to values \( x_k \) for \( k = 1, \ldots, K \), the goal is to fit a quadratic curve of the form:

\[
y = c x^2 + b x + a
\]

where:
- \( c \) is the coefficient of the quadratic term,
- \( b \) is the coefficient of the linear term,
- \( a \) is the constant term.

We aim to minimize the sum of absolute deviations between the observed values \( y_k \) and the predicted values from the quadratic equation, which can be expressed mathematically as:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{k=1}^{K} |y_k - (c x_k^2 + b x_k + a)|
\]

To formulate this as a Linear Programming (LP) problem, we can introduce auxiliary variables \( z_k \) such that:

\[
z_k \geq y_k - (c x_k^2 + b x_k + a) \quad \text{and} \quad z_k \geq -(y_k - (c x_k^2 + b x_k + a))
\]

The problem can then be rephrased as:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{k=1}^{K} z_k
\]

subject to:

\[
z_k \geq y_k - (c x_k^2 + b x_k + a), \quad k = 1, \ldots, K
\]
\[
z_k \geq -(y_k - (c x_k^2 + b x_k + a)), \quad k = 1, \ldots, K
\]

The output coefficients will be represented as follows:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{quadratic} & : c \\
\text{linear} & : b \\
\text{constant} & : a
\end{align*}
\]
