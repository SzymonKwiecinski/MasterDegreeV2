\section*{Rocket Motion Optimization Model}

Let \( x_t \) be the position, \( v_t \) be the velocity, and \( a_t \) be the acceleration at time \( t \). The discrete-time model is given by:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]

\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

We aim to control the acceleration \( a_t \) to minimize fuel consumption, which is proportional to the magnitude of acceleration, hence we define the objective function as follows:

\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

The following constraints must be satisfied:

1. Initial Conditions:
   \[
   x_0 = x_0, \quad v_0 = v_0
   \]

2. Final State Requirements:
   \[
   x_T = x_T, \quad v_T = v_T
   \]

3. Discrete Dynamics:
   For \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \):
   \[
   x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
   \]
   \[
   v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
   \]

\subsection*{Variables}

Define the following variables:
- \( a_t \) for \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \) (acceleration at time \( t \))
- \( x_t \) for \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, T \) (position at time \( t \))
- \( v_t \) for \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, T \) (velocity at time \( t \))

\subsection*{Output}

The expected output format is as follows:

\[
\{
    "x": [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "v": [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "a": [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T-1],
    "fuel\_spend": \text{total fuel spent}
\}
\]

Where:
- \( x \) contains the list of positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
- \( v \) contains the list of velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
- \( a \) contains the list of accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \( T-1 \)
- \( \text{fuel\_spend} \) contains the total fuel spent by the rocket.
