PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

\section*{Rocket Position and Velocity Model}

Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \( t \). The discrete-time model of rocket motion can be described by the following equations:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]

\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

Here, \( a_t \) represents the acceleration which is under our control, determined by the rocket thrust.

Assuming that the magnitude \( |a_t| \) of the acceleration is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \( t \), we define the initial conditions and target conditions as follows:

- Initial position: \( x_0 \)
- Initial velocity: \( v_0 \)
- Target position: \( x_T \)
- Target velocity: \( v_T \)
- Total time: \( T \)

The objective of the optimization problem is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is expressed mathematically as:

\[
\min \max_{t=0,1,\ldots,T} |a_t|
\]

\textbf{Subject to the constraints:}

1. The position and velocity equations:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t, \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
\]

\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t, \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
\]

2. Initial conditions:

\[
x_0 = \text{given}, \quad v_0 = \text{given}
\]

3. Final conditions:

\[
x_T = x_T, \quad v_T = v_T
\]

4. Fuel consumption constraint:

\[
|a_t| \text{ is proportional to fuel consumption}
\]

\textbf{Output:} The solution will yield:

\[
\{
    "x": [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T],
    "v": [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T],
    "a": [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T],
    "fuel\_spend": \text{total fuel spent}
\}
