<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"benefit": [[benefit_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...,K],
	"communication": [[communication_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
	"cost": [[cost_{l, m} for m in 1,...,L] for l in 1,...,L],
}


OBJECTIVE: Where should each department be located so as to minimize overall yearly cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{islocated_{k, l}} represents whether department \var{k} is relocated at city \var{l}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "islocated": [[islocated_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...K],
}

\section*{Mathematical Model of the Relocation Problem}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $K$: Total number of departments
    \item $L$: Total number of possible cities (including London)
    \item $benefit_{k, l}$: Benefits for department $k$ from relocation at city $l$ (in thousands of pounds)
    \item $communication_{k, j}$: Quantity of communication between department $k$ and city $j$
    \item $cost_{l, m}$: Unit cost of communication between city $l$ and city $m$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $islocated_{k, l}$: Binary variable indicating whether department $k$ is located at city $l$ (1 if located, 0 otherwise)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the overall yearly cost, which can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( benefit_{k, l} \cdot islocated_{k, l} - \sum_{j=1}^{K} communication_{k, j} \cdot cost_{l, j} \cdot islocated_{k, l} \right)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each department can only be located in one city:
    \[
    \sum_{l=1}^{L} islocated_{k, l} = 1 \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
    \]
    
    \item No city can host more than three departments:
    \[
    \sum_{k=1}^{K} islocated_{k, l} \leq 3 \quad \forall l = 1, \ldots, L
    \]
    
    \item Binary requirement for decision variables:
    \[
    islocated_{k, l} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K, \, l = 1, \ldots, L
