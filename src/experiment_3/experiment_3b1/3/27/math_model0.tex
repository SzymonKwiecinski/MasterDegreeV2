\section*{Mathematical Model of the Relocation Problem}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $K$: Total number of departments
    \item $L$: Total number of possible cities (including London)
    \item $benefit_{k, l}$: Benefits for department $k$ from relocation at city $l$ (in thousands of pounds)
    \item $communication_{k, j}$: Quantity of communication between department $k$ and city $j$
    \item $cost_{l, m}$: Unit cost of communication between city $l$ and city $m$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $islocated_{k, l}$: Binary variable indicating whether department $k$ is located at city $l$ (1 if located, 0 otherwise)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the overall yearly cost, which can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( benefit_{k, l} \cdot islocated_{k, l} - \sum_{j=1}^{K} communication_{k, j} \cdot cost_{l, j} \cdot islocated_{k, l} \right)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each department can only be located in one city:
    \[
    \sum_{l=1}^{L} islocated_{k, l} = 1 \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
    \]
    
    \item No city can host more than three departments:
    \[
    \sum_{k=1}^{K} islocated_{k, l} \leq 3 \quad \forall l = 1, \ldots, L
    \]
    
    \item Binary requirement for decision variables:
    \[
    islocated_{k, l} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K, \, l = 1, \ldots, L
    \end{itemize}
