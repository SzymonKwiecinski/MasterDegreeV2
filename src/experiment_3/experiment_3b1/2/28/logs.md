PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A quantity y is known to depend on another quantity x. A set of corresponding values has been collected for x and y and is presented.
- The \var{k}-th y value takes \var{y_{k}} and the \var{k}-th x value takes \var{x_{k}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "y": [y_{k} for k = 1,...,K],
    "x": [x_{k} for k = 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Fit the ‘best’ straight line y = bx + a to this set of data points. The objective is to minimise the sum of absolute deviations of each observed value of y from the value predicted by the linear relationship.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{intercept} represents the intercept of the fitted line
- \var{slope} represents the slope of the fitted line

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Linear Regression}

Given a set of observed values \(y_k\) and corresponding values \(x_k\) for \(k = 1, \ldots, K\), we want to fit a linear model of the form:

\[
y = bx + a
\]

where \(b\) is the slope and \(a\) is the intercept. Our objective is to minimize the sum of absolute deviations of each observed value of \(y\) from the predicted value based on the linear relationship. This can be formulated as:

\[
\text{minimize} \quad \sum_{k=1}^{K} |y_k - (bx_k + a)|
\]

To handle the absolute values, we introduce auxiliary variables \(d_k\) for each \(k\), representing the deviations:

\[
d_k \geq y_k - (bx_k + a) \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
\]
\[
d_k \geq -(y_k - (bx_k + a)) \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
\]

The complete linear programming formulation is then:

\[
\text{minimize} \quad \sum_{k=1}^{K} d_k
\]

subject to:

\[
d_k \geq y_k - (bx_k + a) \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
\]
\[
d_k \geq -(y_k - (bx_k + a)) \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
\]

The variables to be optimized are \(b\), \(a\), and \(d_k\) for each \(k\). 

Upon solving this linear program, the optimal values for \(a\) and \(b\) will yield our desired intercept and slope.

\section*{Output}

The output will provide the following values:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{intercept} represents the intercept of the fitted line \(a\).
    \item \texttt{slope} represents the slope of the fitted line \(b\).
\end{itemize}
