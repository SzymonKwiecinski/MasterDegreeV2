PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

\section*{Mathematical Model for Rocket Motion}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_t \): Position of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( v_t \): Velocity of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( a_t \): Acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( T \): Total time for the journey
    \item \( x_0 \): Initial position
    \item \( v_0 \): Initial velocity
    \item \( x_T \): Target position
    \item \( v_T \): Target velocity
\end{itemize}

The discrete-time model is defined by the following equations:
\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]
\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

We need to find the acceleration \( a_t \) for \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \), under the constraints given below, while minimizing the maximum thrust required.

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is expressed as:
\[
\text{Minimize } \max_{t} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
The constraints based on initial conditions and final targets are:
\[
x_0 = x_0 \quad \text{(initial position)}
\]
\[
v_0 = v_0 \quad \text{(initial velocity)}
\]
\[
x_T = x_T \quad \text{(target position)}
\]
\[
v_T = v_T \quad \text{(target velocity)}
\]

The evolution of the states gives us these implicit constraints:
\[
x_{t+1} - x_t - v_t = 0, \quad \forall t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T-1\}
\]
\[
v_{t+1} - v_t - a_t = 0, \quad \forall t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T-1\}
\]

\subsection*{Fuel Consumption}
Assuming fuel consumption is proportional to the magnitude of acceleration:
\[
\text{Fuel spent} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
The decision variables are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( a_t \) for \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Summary of Output}
The output will consist of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A list of positions \( x_i \) for \( i = 0, 1, \ldots, T \)
    \item A list of velocities \( v_i \) for \( i = 0, 1, \ldots, T \)
    \item A list of accelerations \( a_i \) for \( i = 0, 1, \ldots, T \)
    \item Total fuel spent
\end{itemize}
