PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Suppose that there are \var{N} available currencies, and assume that one unit of currency \var{i} can be exchanged for \var{rate_{i,j}} units of currency \var{j} (Naturally, we assume that \var{rate_{i,j}} > 0).
- There are also certain regulations that impose a limit \var{limit_i} on the total amount of currency \var{i} that can be exchanged (whether to other currencies or from other currencies) on any given day.
- Suppose that we start the day with \var{start_i} units of currency \var{i}
- Provide a linear programming formulation of this problem. Assume that for any sequence \var{i_1}, â€¦ ,\var{i_k} of currencies, we have \var{rate_{i_1,i_2}}, \var{rate_{i_2,i_3}}, ..., \var{rate_{i_{k-1}, i_{k}}, \var{rate_{i_k, i_1}} <= 1, which means that wealth cannot be multiplied by going through a cycle of currencies.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "start": [start_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "limit": [limit_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "rate": [[rate_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., N] for i in 1, ..., N],
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to maximize the number of units of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day, through a sequence of currency transactions.

OUTPUT INFO: 

- The output json file contains a list of transactions, where each transaction is a json object with the following fields:
    - from: the currency that we are exchanging from
    - to: the currency that we are exchanging to
    - amount: the amount of currency that we are exchanging
- The output json file also contains the final amount of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day.

OUTPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": i,
            "to": j,
            "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
    ],
    "final_amount_of_currency_N": final_amount_of_currency_N

\section*{Linear Programming Formulation}

Given the problem, we define the following variables and constants:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( x_{i,j} \) be the amount of currency \( i \) exchanged for currency \( j \).
    \item Let \( start_i \) be the initial amount of currency \( i \).
    \item Let \( limit_i \) be the limit on the total amount of currency \( i \) that can be exchanged.
    \item Let \( rate_{i,j} \) be the exchange rate from currency \( i \) to currency \( j \).
    \item Let \( N \) be the total number of currencies.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to maximize the amount of currency \( N \) we end up with at the end of the day. Thus, the objective function can be formulated as:

\[
\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{N,j}
\]

where \( x_{N,j} \) is the amount of currency \( N \) exchanged for currency \( j \).

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. **Currency Exchange Limits**:
   For each currency \( i \), the total amount of currency exchanged cannot exceed the limit:

   \[
   \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} \leq limit_i, \quad \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}
   \]

2. **Initial Amounts**:
   The amount of each currency after transactions must not exceed the initially available amount. For currency \( i \):

   \[
   start_i - \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} + \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{j,i} \geq 0, \quad \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}
   \]

3. **Exchange Rates**:
    The amount exchanged must respect the exchange rates:

   \[
   x_{i,j} \leq start_i \cdot rate_{i,j}, \quad \forall i,j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}
   \]

4. **Non-negativity**:
   All exchange amounts must be non-negative:

   \[
   x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall i,j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}
   \]
