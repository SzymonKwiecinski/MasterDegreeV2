\section*{Linear Programming Model}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T$: Total number of months
    \item $deliver_i$: Units of product that must be delivered at the end of month $i$ for $i = 1, \ldots, T$
    \item $storage\_cost$: Cost of storing one unit of product for one month
    \item $switch\_cost$: Cost incurred when switching production levels between two consecutive months
    \item $x_i$: Number of units produced in month $i$
    \item $I_i$: Inventory at the end of month $i$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}

The objective is to minimize the total cost, which includes production costs, storage costs, and switching costs:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{i=1}^{T} (storage\_cost \cdot I_i + switch\_cost \cdot |x_{i+1} - x_i|)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. **Inventory Balance:**
   The inventory at the end of each month is given by:
   \[
   I_i = I_{i-1} + x_i - deliver_i \quad \text{for } i = 1, \ldots, T
   \]
   with the initial condition:
   \[
   I_0 = 0
   \]

2. **Non-negativity Constraints:**
   \[
   x_i \geq 0 \quad \text{for } i = 1, \ldots, T
   \]
   
3. **Final Inventory Constraint:**
   The inventory at the end of the last month should be zero:
   \[
   I_T = 0
   \]
