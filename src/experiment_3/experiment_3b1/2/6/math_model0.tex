\section*{Mathematical Model for Rocket Trajectory Optimization}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The discrete-time dynamics of the rocket can be described by the following equations:

\begin{align}
x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \\
v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t
\end{align}

The initial conditions are given as:

\[
x_0 = x_0, \quad v_0 = v_0
\]

Our goal is to reach a target position \( x_T \) with a target velocity \( v_T \) at time \( T \):

\begin{align}
x_T &= x_T \\
v_T &= v_T
\end{align}

The acceleration \( a_t \) is controlled and the model assumes that the magnitude \( |a_t| \) is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption. Therefore, we want to minimize the total fuel consumption, which can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

Subject to the dynamics constraints and the initial and final conditions. 

\textbf{Decision Variables:}

Let \( a_t \) for \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \) be the decision variables representing the acceleration at each time step.

\textbf{Constraints:}

1. Position and velocity update constraints:
   \[
   \begin{align}
   x_{t+1} - x_t - v_t &= 0 \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
   v_{t+1} - v_t - a_t &= 0 \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \end{align}
   \]

2. Initial conditions:
   \[
   x_0 \text{ and } v_0 \text{ are given}
   \]

3. Final target conditions:
   \[
   x_T \text{ and } v_T \text{ are specified}
   \]

\textbf{Output Variables:}

Let the output variables be defined as follows:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{"x"} & : [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T] \\
\text{"v"} & : [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T] \\
\text{"a"} & : [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1] \\
\text{"fuel\_spend"} & : \text{total fuel spent}
\end{align*}
\]

This completes the mathematical formulation for optimizing the rocket's trajectory while minimizing fuel consumption.
