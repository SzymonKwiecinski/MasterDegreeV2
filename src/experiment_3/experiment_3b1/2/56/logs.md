PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

\section*{Problem Definition}

Let a delivery person start at the intersection of the 1st Avenue and 1st Street and reach the intersection of the Wth Avenue and Nth Street on an $N-1 \times W-1$ grid.

\subsection*{Variables}

Define the following variables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{n,w} = 1$ if the delivery person moves north from intersection $(w,n)$ to $(w,n+1)$; 0 otherwise.
    \item $y_{n,w} = 1$ if the delivery person moves west from intersection $(w,n)$ to $(w+1,n)$; 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $west\_time_{n,w}$ be the time to move from $(w,n)$ to $(w+1,n)$.
    \item $north\_time_{n,w}$ be the time to move from $(w,n)$ to $(w,n+1)$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}

Minimize the total time taken:
\[
\text{minimize } Z = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} (west\_time_{n,w} \cdot y_{n,w} + north\_time_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w})
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. The flow conservation at each intersection:
\[
\sum_{w=1}^{W-1} y_{n,w} = 1 \quad \forall n \quad (1 \leq n \leq N)
\]
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n,w} = 1 \quad \forall w \quad (1 \leq w \leq W)
\]

2. The delivery person can only move either north or west:
\[
x_{n,w} + y_{n,w} \leq 1 \quad \forall n, w
\]

3. Non-negativity constraints:
\[
x_{n,w} \geq 0, \quad y_{n,w} \geq 0 \quad \forall n, w
\]

\subsection*{Output}

The output will be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{paths}: The specific intersections taken on the optimal path.
    \item \textit{total\_time}: The minimum total time taken to deliver the package.
\end{itemize}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
Here is the Python script using the Pulp library to model the linear programming problem for delivery path optimization based on the provided mathematical model:

```python
import pulp
import json

#### Given data in JSON format
data = {'west_time': [[3.5, 4.5], [4, 4], [5, 4]], 'north_time': [[10, 10, 9], [9, 9, 12]]}

#### Extracting the dimensions
N = len(data['north_time'])    #### Number of North steps
W = len(data['west_time'][0])  #### Number of West steps

#### Create the LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("DeliveryPathOptimization", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Creating decision variables
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("North", ((n, w) for n in range(N) for w in range(W)), 0, 1, pulp.LpBinary)
y = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("West", ((n, w) for n in range(N) for w in range(W-1)), 0, 1, pulp.LpBinary)

#### Objective function
problem += pulp.lpSum(data['west_time'][n][w] * y[n, w] + data['north_time'][n][w] * x[n, w] 
                       for n in range(N) for w in range(W-1)), "TotalTime"

#### Constraints
#### Flow conservation at each intersection
for n in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(y[n, w] for w in range(W-1)) == 1, f"FlowConservationNorth_{n}"

for w in range(W):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[n, w] for n in range(N)) == 1, f"FlowConservationWest_{w}"

#### Movement restrictions
for n in range(N):
    for w in range(W-1):
        problem += x[n, w] + y[n, w] <= 1, f"MovementRestriction_{n}_{w}"

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Output results
paths = []
for n in range(N):
    for w in range(W-1):
        if pulp.value(x[n, w]) == 1:
            paths.append(f"Move North from ({w}, {n}) to ({w}, {n + 1})")
        if pulp.value(y[n, w]) == 1:
            paths.append(f"Move West from ({w}, {n}) to ({w + 1}, {n})")

#### Print the results
print("Optimal Paths:")
for path in paths:
    print(path)
print(f' (Objective Value): <OBJ>{pulp.value(problem.objective)}</OBJ>')
```

In this script:
- We define our problem using the Pulp library.
- Decision variables \(x\) and \(y\) are created for movements.
- The objective function is set to minimize the total time based on the provided west and north travel times.
- Constraints are added to ensure proper flow through the grid.
- Finally, the optimal paths and the objective value are printed.
