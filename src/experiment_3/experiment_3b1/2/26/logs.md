<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- An economy consists of several industries. 
- Each unit produced by one of the industries (a unit will be taken as £1’s worth of value of production) requires inputs from possibly its own industry as well as other industries. 
- Industry \var{k} requires \var{inputone_{k, j}} input from industy \var{j}.
- Industry \var{k} requires \var{manpowerone_{k}} units of manpower.
- There is a time lag in the economy so that the output in year t + 1 requires an input in year t.
- Output from an industry may also be used to build productive capacity for itself or other industries in future years.
- To give unit increases (capacity for £1’s worth of extra production) in productive capacity of industry \var{k}, \var{j} units of industry \var{inputtwo_{k, j}} and \var{manpowertwo{k}} units of manpower are needed.
- Input from an industry in year t results in a (permanent) increase in productive capacity in year t + 2.
- Stocks of goods may be held from year to year. 
- At present (year 0), the stocks of industry \var{k} is \var{stock_{k}}, and the capacity of industry \var{k} is \var{capacity_{k}}.
- An exogenous consumption requirement of \var{demand_{k}} units from industry \var{k} has to be satisfied in every year except year 0.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "inputone": [[inputone_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
    "manpowerone": [manpowerone_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "inputtwo": [[inputtwo_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
    "manpowertwo": [manpowertwo_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "stock": [stock_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "capacity": [capacity_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "demand": [demand_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Maximize the total manpower requirement over five years

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{produce} represents the amount of units produced by each industry in each year
- \var{buildcapa} represents the amount of units used to build productive capacity for each industry in each year
- \var{stockhold} represents the amount of stock of each industry held in each year

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "produce": [[produce_{k, t} for t in 1,...,T] for k in 1,...,K],
    "buildcapa": [[buildcapa_{k, t} for t in 1,...,T] for k in 1,...,K],
    "stockhold": [[stock_{k, t} for t in 1,...,T] for for k in 1,...,K]

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}

Maximize the total manpower requirement over five years:

\[
\text{Maximize } \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sum_{k=1}^{K} manpowerone_{k} \cdot produce_{k, t} + manpowertwo_{k} \cdot buildcapa_{k, t}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. **Production Capacity:**
   \[
   produce_{k, t} + stock_{k, t-1} - stock_{k, t} \leq capacity_{k} \quad \forall k = 1,\ldots,K, \; t = 1,\ldots,T
   \]

2. **Demand Satisfaction:**

   \]

3. **Manpower Requirement for Production:**
   \[
   manpowerone_{k} \cdot produce_{k, t} \leq \text{Available Manpower at year } t \quad \forall k = 1,\ldots,K, \; t = 1,\ldots,T
   \]

4. **Building Capacity:**
   \[
   buildcapa_{k, t} \leq stock_{k, t} \quad \forall k = 1,\ldots,K, \; t = 1,\ldots,T
   \]

5. **Stock Holding:**
   \[
   stock_{k, t} = stock_{k, t-1} + produce_{k, t} - demand_{k} \quad \forall k = 1,\ldots,K, \; t = 1,\ldots,T
   \]

6. **Capacity Building Delay:**
   \[
   capacity_{k} + \sum_{t=1}^{T-2} buildcapa_{k, t} \geq capacity_{k} + \sum_{t=1}^{T} produce_{k, t} \quad \forall k = 1,\ldots,K
   \]

\subsection*{Output Variables}

The output variables to be calculated are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( produce_{k, t} \): Amount of units produced by each industry in each year
    \item \( buildcapa_{k, t} \): Amount of units used to build productive capacity for each industry in each year
    \item \( stockhold_{k, t} \): Amount of stock of each industry held in each year
