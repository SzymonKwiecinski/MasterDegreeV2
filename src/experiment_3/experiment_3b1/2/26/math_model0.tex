\section*{Mathematical Model for the Economy Problem}

\subsection*{Definitions}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( K \): Number of industries
    \item \( T \): Number of years (in this case, 5)
    \item \( produce_{k, t} \): Amount of units produced by industry \( k \) in year \( t \)
    \item \( buildcapa_{k, t} \): Amount of units used to build productive capacity for industry \( k \) in year \( t \)
    \item \( stock_{k, t} \): Amount of stock of industry \( k \) held in year \( t \)
    \item \( inputone_{k, j} \): Units of input from industry \( j \) required by industry \( k \)
    \item \( manpowerone_{k} \): Units of manpower required by industry \( k \)
    \item \( inputtwo_{k, j} \): Units of input for building capacity from industry \( j \) required by industry \( k \)
    \item \( manpowertwo_{k} \): Units of manpower for building capacity for industry \( k \)
    \item \( stock_{k} \): Initial stock of industry \( k \)
    \item \( capacity_{k} \): Initial capacity of industry \( k \)
    \item \( demand_{k} \): Exogenous consumption requirement of industry \( k \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}

Maximize the total manpower requirement over five years:

\[
\text{Maximize } \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sum_{k=1}^{K} manpowerone_{k} \cdot produce_{k, t} + manpowertwo_{k} \cdot buildcapa_{k, t}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. **Production Capacity:**
   \[
   produce_{k, t} + stock_{k, t-1} - stock_{k, t} \leq capacity_{k} \quad \forall k = 1,\ldots,K, \; t = 1,\ldots,T
   \]

2. **Demand Satisfaction:**
   \[
   produce_{k, t} + stock_{k, t-1} \geq demand_{k} + stock_{k, t} \quad \forall k = 1,\ldots,K, \; t = 1,\ldots,T, \; t \neq 0
   \]

3. **Manpower Requirement for Production:**
   \[
   manpowerone_{k} \cdot produce_{k, t} \leq \text{Available Manpower at year } t \quad \forall k = 1,\ldots,K, \; t = 1,\ldots,T
   \]

4. **Building Capacity:**
   \[
   buildcapa_{k, t} \leq stock_{k, t} \quad \forall k = 1,\ldots,K, \; t = 1,\ldots,T
   \]

5. **Stock Holding:**
   \[
   stock_{k, t} = stock_{k, t-1} + produce_{k, t} - demand_{k} \quad \forall k = 1,\ldots,K, \; t = 1,\ldots,T
   \]

6. **Capacity Building Delay:**
   \[
   capacity_{k} + \sum_{t=1}^{T-2} buildcapa_{k, t} \geq capacity_{k} + \sum_{t=1}^{T} produce_{k, t} \quad \forall k = 1,\ldots,K
   \]

\subsection*{Output Variables}

The output variables to be calculated are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( produce_{k, t} \): Amount of units produced by each industry in each year
    \item \( buildcapa_{k, t} \): Amount of units used to build productive capacity for each industry in each year
    \item \( stockhold_{k, t} \): Amount of stock of each industry held in each year
\end{itemize}
