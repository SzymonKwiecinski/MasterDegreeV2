PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT:

    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is max_t |a_t|. 

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "fuel_spend" contains the total fuel spent by the rocket

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_t \) be the position of the rocket at time \( t \).
    \item \( v_t \) be the velocity of the rocket at time \( t \).
    \item \( a_t \) be the acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \).
    \item \( x_0 \) be the initial position of the rocket.
    \item \( v_0 \) be the initial velocity of the rocket.
    \item \( x_T \) be the target position at time \( T \).
    \item \( v_T \) be the target velocity at time \( T \).
    \item \( T \) be the total time of travel.
\end{itemize}

The discrete-time dynamics of the rocket can be described by the following equations:
\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]
\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is represented as:
\[
\min \max_{t} |a_t|
\]

Subject to the following constraints:

1. Initial conditions:
    \[
    x_0 = \text{given initial position}
    \]
    \[
    v_0 = \text{given initial velocity}
    \]

2. Final conditions:
    \[
    x_T = \text{target position}
    \]
    \[
    v_T = \text{target velocity}
    \]

3. For each time step \( t \) from 0 to \( T-1 \):
    \[
    x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
    \]
    \[
    v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
    \]

4. The fuel consumption is proportional to the absolute value of acceleration:
   \[
   \text{Fuel Consumption} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
   \]

The output format should include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x = [x_i \text{ for } i \text{ in } 0, \ldots, T] \)
    \item \( v = [v_i \text{ for } i \text{ in } 0, \ldots, T] \)
    \item \( a = [a_i \text{ for } i \text{ in } 0, \ldots, T] \)
    \item \( \text{fuel\_spend} = \text{total fuel spent} \)
