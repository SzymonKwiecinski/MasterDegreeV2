PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Suppose that there are \var{N} available currencies, and assume that one unit of currency \var{i} can be exchanged for \var{rate_{i,j}} units of currency \var{j} (Naturally, we assume that \var{rate_{i,j}} > 0).
- There are also certain regulations that impose a limit \var{limit_i} on the total amount of currency \var{i} that can be exchanged (whether to other currencies or from other currencies) on any given day.
- Suppose that we start the day with \var{start_i} units of currency \var{i}
- Provide a linear programming formulation of this problem. Assume that for any sequence \var{i_1}, â€¦ ,\var{i_k} of currencies, we have \var{rate_{i_1,i_2}}, \var{rate_{i_2,i_3}}, ..., \var{rate_{i_{k-1}, i_{k}}, \var{rate_{i_k, i_1}} <= 1, which means that wealth cannot be multiplied by going through a cycle of currencies.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "start": [start_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "limit": [limit_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "rate": [[rate_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., N] for i in 1, ..., N],
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to maximize the number of units of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day, through a sequence of currency transactions.

OUTPUT INFO: 

- The output json file contains a list of transactions, where each transaction is a json object with the following fields:
    - from: the currency that we are exchanging from
    - to: the currency that we are exchanging to
    - amount: the amount of currency that we are exchanging
- The output json file also contains the final amount of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day.

OUTPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": i,
            "to": j,
            "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
    ],
    "final_amount_of_currency_N": final_amount_of_currency_N

Given the parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( N \) be the number of available currencies.
    \item Let \( start_i \) be the starting amount of currency \( i \).
    \item Let \( limit_i \) be the limit on the amount of currency \( i \) that can be exchanged.
    \item Let \( rate_{i,j} \) be the exchange rate from currency \( i \) to currency \( j \) where \( rate_{i,j} > 0 \).
\end{itemize}

Define the decision variables:
\[
x_{i,j} \quad \text{amount of currency } i \text{ exchanged for currency } j
\]

Our objective is to maximize the total amount of currency \( N \) we have at the end of the day, formally expressed as:
\[
\text{Maximize } z = x_{N,i} + x_{N,j} + \ldots + x_{N,k} \quad \forall k \neq N
\]

Subject to the following constraints:

1. **Currency Transactions Limits:**
   \[
   x_{i,j} \leq limit_i \quad \forall i,j
   \]

2. **Starting Constraints:**
   \[
   x_{i,j} \leq start_i \quad \forall i,j
   \]

3. **Flow Conservation:**
   \[
   x_{i,j} - x_{j,i} = 0, \quad \forall i \neq j
   \]

4. **Wealth Inequality Constraint:**
   \[
   rate_{i,j} x_{i,j} \leq start_j \quad \forall i,j, \text{ such that } rate_{i,j} \leq 1
   \]

5. **Non-negativity Constraints:**
   \[
   x_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \forall i,j
   \]

The output will include a list of transactions and the final amount of currency \( N \):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transactions format:
    \[
    \text{transactions} = \{ 
    \text{from}: i, 
    \text{to}: j, 
    \text{amount}: x_{i,j} 
    \}
    \]
    \item Final amount:
    \[
    \text{final\_amount\_of\_currency\_N} = total
    \]
\end{itemize}
