PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time

\section{Problem Definition}

Consider a delivery person starting at the intersection of the 1st Avenue and 1st Street and needing to reach the intersection of the Wth Avenue and Nth Street on a grid formed by N-1 rows and W-1 columns. The delivery person can only move north or west, and the unique walking times for each block vary due to pedestrian traffic.

\section{Variables}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_{n,w} \): binary variable indicating if the path from intersection \((w, n)\) to \((w+1, n)\) is used (west movement).
    \item \( y_{n,w} \): binary variable indicating if the path from intersection \((w, n)\) to \((w, n+1)\) is used (north movement).
\end{itemize}

\section{Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{west\_time}_{n,w} \): time taken to move west from intersection \((w, n)\) to \((w+1, n)\).
    \item \( \text{north\_time}_{n,w} \): time taken to move north from intersection \((w, n)\) to \((w, n+1)\).
\end{itemize}

\section{Objective Function}

The objective is to minimize the total time taken, defined as:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} \left( \text{west\_time}_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w} + \text{north\_time}_{n,w} \cdot y_{n,w} \right)
\]

\section{Constraints}

The following constraints must hold:

1. Flow conservation for west movements:
\[
\sum_{w=1}^{W-1} x_{n,w} \leq 1 \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N-1\}
\]

2. Flow conservation for north movements:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} y_{n,w} \leq 1 \quad \forall w \in \{1, \ldots, W-1\}
\]

3. Boundary and Initial Conditions:
\[
x_{1,1} + y_{1,1} = 1
\]
\[
x_{N-1,W-1} + y_{N-1,W-1} = 0
\]

4. Binary constraints:
\[
x_{n,w} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall n,w
\]
\[
y_{n,w} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall n,w
\]

\section{Output}

The output consists of the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{"paths"}: A list of tuples \((\text{street}_{n}, \text{avenue}_{w})\) indicating the optimal path.
    \item \texttt{"total\_time"}: Total time taken to travel the path.
\end{itemize}
