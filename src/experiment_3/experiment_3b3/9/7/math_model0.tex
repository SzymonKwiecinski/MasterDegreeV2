\section*{Rocket Motion Optimization Problem}

We are tasked with modeling the motion of a rocket along a straight path using a linear programming approach. We define:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_t \): position of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( v_t \): velocity of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( a_t \): acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \)
\end{itemize}

The discrete-time model is given by the following equations:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t
\end{align}

We control the acceleration \( a_t \), which is related to the thrust and, in turn, to the fuel consumption. Our objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, defined as:

\[
\text{Minimize } \max_{t} |a_t|
\]

### Inputs

The inputs are defined as follows:

\begin{align*}
    x_0 & : \text{initial position} \\
    v_0 & : \text{initial velocity} \\
    x_T & : \text{target position} \\
    v_T & : \text{target velocity} \\
    T & : \text{total time}
\end{align*}

### Constraints

We have the following constraints based on the motion equations:

\begin{align}
    x_T &= x_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} v_t \\
    v_T &= v_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} a_t
\end{align}

Additionally, we assume that the acceleration is bounded:

\[
|a_t| \leq M \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
\]

where \( M \) is a constant that represents the maximum thrust.

### Outputs

The required outputs are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x \): a list of positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( v \): a list of velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( a \): a list of accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( \text{fuel\_spend} \): total fuel spent by the rocket
\end{itemize}

The output format is specified as follows:

\[
\text{Output} = \{
    "x": [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "v": [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "a": [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "fuel\_spend": \text{fuel\_spent}
\}
\]
