PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

\section*{Rocket Motion Optimization Problem}

We are tasked with modeling the motion of a rocket along a straight path using a linear programming approach. We define:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_t \): position of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( v_t \): velocity of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( a_t \): acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \)
\end{itemize}

The discrete-time model is given by the following equations:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t
\end{align}

We control the acceleration \( a_t \), which is related to the thrust and, in turn, to the fuel consumption. Our objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, defined as:

\[
\text{Minimize } \max_{t} |a_t|
\]

######### Inputs

The inputs are defined as follows:

\begin{align*}
    x_0 & : \text{initial position} \\
    v_0 & : \text{initial velocity} \\
    x_T & : \text{target position} \\
    v_T & : \text{target velocity} \\
    T & : \text{total time}
\end{align*}

######### Constraints

We have the following constraints based on the motion equations:

\begin{align}
    x_T &= x_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} v_t \\
    v_T &= v_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} a_t
\end{align}

Additionally, we assume that the acceleration is bounded:

\[
|a_t| \leq M \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
\]

where \( M \) is a constant that represents the maximum thrust.

######### Outputs

The required outputs are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x \): a list of positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( v \): a list of velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( a \): a list of accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( \text{fuel\_spend} \): total fuel spent by the rocket
\end{itemize}

The output format is specified as follows:

\[
\text{Output} = \{
    "x": [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "v": [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "a": [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "fuel\_spend": \text{fuel\_spent}
\}
