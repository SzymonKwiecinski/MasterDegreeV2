PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a road divided into \var{N} segments that is illuminated by \var{M} lamps.
- Let \var{power_j} be the power of the \var{j}-th lamp. The illumination \var{ill_i} of the \var{i}-th segment is assumed to be \sum_{j=1}^{\var{M}} \var{coeff_{i,j}} \var{power_j}, where \var{coeff_{i,j}} are known coefficients.
- Let \var{desired_i} be the desired illumination of road \var{i}. 
- We are interested in choosing the lamp powers \var{power_j} so that the illuminations {ill_i} are close to the desired illuminations {desired_i}.

{
    "coeff": [[coeff_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., M] for i in 1, ..., N],

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Lamp Power Optimization}

\subsection*{Problem Definition}

We have a road divided into \(N\) segments illuminated by \(M\) lamps. The illumination of the \(i\)-th segment can be expressed as:

\[
\text{ill}_i = \sum_{j=1}^{M} \text{coeff}_{i,j} \cdot \text{power}_j
\]

where \(\text{coeff}_{i,j}\) are known coefficients that represent the contribution of lamp \(j\) to the illumination of segment \(i\). The goal is to choose the lamp powers \(\text{power}_j\) such that the illuminations of the segments are as close as possible to the desired illumination levels.

\subsection*{Objective Function}

We define the absolute error for each segment \(i\) as:

\[
\text{error}_i = | \text{ill}_i - \text{desired}_i |
\]

We aim to minimize the total absolute error across all segments:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{error}_i
\]

This can be rewritten by introducing auxiliary variables \(e_i\) to represent the errors:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{N} e_i
\]

subject to the constraints:

\[
\text{ill}_i - \text{desired}_i \leq e_i \quad \forall i
\]
\[
-\text{ill}_i + \text{desired}_i \leq e_i \quad \forall i
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

The illumination for each segment can be expressed as:

\[
\text{ill}_i = \sum_{j=1}^{M} \text{coeff}_{i,j} \cdot \text{power}_j \quad \forall i
\]

\subsection*{Decision Variables}

The decision variables in this model are:

- \(\text{power}_j\): the power of the \(j\)-th lamp for \(j = 1, \ldots, M\)
- \(e_i\): the absolute error for the \(i\)-th segment for \(i = 1, \ldots, N\)

\subsection*{Final Model Formulation}

The complete linear programming model can be formulated as follows:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize} \quad & \sum_{i=1}^{N} e_i \\
\text{subject to} \quad & \text{ill}_i = \sum_{j=1}^{M} \text{coeff}_{i,j} \cdot \text{power}_j, \quad \forall i \\
& \text{ill}_i - \text{desired}_i \leq e_i, \quad \forall i \\
& -\text{ill}_i + \text{desired}_i \leq e_i, \quad \forall i \\
& \text{power}_j \geq 0, \quad \forall j \\
\end{align*}
\]

\subsection*{Output}

The optimal solution will yield:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\text{power}_j\): the optimal power of the \(j\)-th lamp for \(j = 1, \ldots, M\)
    \item \(\text{error}\): the total absolute error between the illuminations and desired illuminations
\end{itemize}
