\section*{Linear Programming Model for School Assignment Problem}

\textbf{Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N$: Number of neighborhoods
    \item $S$: Number of schools
    \item $G$: Number of grades
    \item $capacity_{s,g}$: Capacity of school $s$ for grade $g$
    \item $population_{n,g}$: Student population in neighborhood $n$ for grade $g$
    \item $d_{n,s}$: Distance from neighborhood $n$ to school $s$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{n,s,g}$: Number of students of grade $g$ in neighborhood $n$ assigned to school $s$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective Function:}
Minimize the total distance traveled by all students:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{s=1}^{S} \sum_{g=1}^{G} d_{n,s} \cdot x_{n,s,g}
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}

1. Capacity constraint for each school and grade:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n,s,g} \leq capacity_{s,g} \quad \forall s=1,\ldots,S, \ g=1,\ldots,G
\]

2. Demand constraint for each neighborhood and grade:
\[
\sum_{s=1}^{S} x_{n,s,g} = population_{n,g} \quad \forall n=1,\ldots,N, \ g=1,\ldots,G
\]

3. Non-negativity constraint:
\[
x_{n,s,g} \geq 0 \quad \forall n=1,\ldots,N, \ s=1,\ldots,S, \ g=1,\ldots,G
\]

\textbf{Output:}
- The values of $x_{n,s,g}$ for all $n$, $s$, and $g$.
- The total distance, calculated as $Z$.
