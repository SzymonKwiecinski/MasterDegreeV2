\section*{Problem Description}

A large company wishes to relocate some of its departments out of London to various cities while minimizing the overall yearly cost incurred from the relocation. The cost includes both the benefits derived from relocation and the communication costs between departments.

\section*{Sets}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $K$: Set of departments, where $k \in K$.
    \item $L$: Set of cities, where $l \in L$.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $benefit_{k, l}$: Benefit for department $k$ from relocation at city $l$ (in thousands of pounds).
    \item $communication_{k, j}$: Quantity of communication between department $k$ and department $j$.
    \item $cost_{l, m}$: Unit cost of communication between city $l$ and city $m$.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Decision Variables}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $islocated_{k, l}$: Binary variable that equals 1 if department $k$ is relocated to city $l$, and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Objective Function}

Minimize the overall yearly cost, which can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad Z = \sum_{k \in K} \sum_{l \in L} \left( \text{cost of communication} + \text{benefit from relocation} \right)
\]

Where the cost of communication can be determined as follows:

\[
\sum_{j \in K} \sum_{m \in L} communication_{k, j} \cdot cost_{l, m} \cdot islocated_{j, m}
\]

Thus, the objective function can be rewritten as:

\[
Z = \sum_{k \in K} \sum_{l \in L} \left( \sum_{j \in K} \sum_{m \in L} communication_{k, j} \cdot cost_{l, m} \cdot islocated_{j, m} \right) - \sum_{k \in K} \sum_{l \in L} benefit_{k, l} \cdot islocated_{k, l}
\]

\section*{Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Each department must be located in exactly one city:

    \[
    \sum_{l \in L} islocated_{k, l} = 1, \quad \forall k \in K
    \]

    \item A city can accommodate at most three departments:

    \[
    \sum_{k \in K} islocated_{k, l} \leq 3, \quad \forall l \in L
    \]

    \item Binary constraints:

    \[
    islocated_{k, l} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall k \in K, \forall l \in L
    \]
\end{itemize}

\section*{Output Format}

The solution will provide the locations for each department in the following format:

\[
\text{islocated} = [[islocated_{k, l} \text{ for } l \in 1,...,L] \text{ for } k \in 1,...,K]
\]
