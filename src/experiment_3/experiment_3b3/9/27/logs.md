PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"benefit": [[benefit_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...,K],
	"communication": [[communication_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
	"cost": [[cost_{l, m} for m in 1,...,L] for l in 1,...,L],
}


OBJECTIVE: Where should each department be located so as to minimize overall yearly cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{islocated_{k, l}} represents whether department \var{k} is relocated at city \var{l}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "islocated": [[islocated_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...K],

\section*{Problem Description}

A large company wishes to relocate some of its departments out of London to various cities while minimizing the overall yearly cost incurred from the relocation. The cost includes both the benefits derived from relocation and the communication costs between departments.

\section*{Sets}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $K$: Set of departments, where $k \in K$.
    \item $L$: Set of cities, where $l \in L$.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $benefit_{k, l}$: Benefit for department $k$ from relocation at city $l$ (in thousands of pounds).
    \item $communication_{k, j}$: Quantity of communication between department $k$ and department $j$.
    \item $cost_{l, m}$: Unit cost of communication between city $l$ and city $m$.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Decision Variables}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $islocated_{k, l}$: Binary variable that equals 1 if department $k$ is relocated to city $l$, and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Objective Function}

Minimize the overall yearly cost, which can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad Z = \sum_{k \in K} \sum_{l \in L} \left( \text{cost of communication} + \text{benefit from relocation} \right)
\]

Where the cost of communication can be determined as follows:

\[
\sum_{j \in K} \sum_{m \in L} communication_{k, j} \cdot cost_{l, m} \cdot islocated_{j, m}
\]

Thus, the objective function can be rewritten as:

\[
Z = \sum_{k \in K} \sum_{l \in L} \left( \sum_{j \in K} \sum_{m \in L} communication_{k, j} \cdot cost_{l, m} \cdot islocated_{j, m} \right) - \sum_{k \in K} \sum_{l \in L} benefit_{k, l} \cdot islocated_{k, l}
\]

\section*{Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Each department must be located in exactly one city:

    \[
    \sum_{l \in L} islocated_{k, l} = 1, \quad \forall k \in K
    \]

    \item A city can accommodate at most three departments:

    \[
    \sum_{k \in K} islocated_{k, l} \leq 3, \quad \forall l \in L
    \]

    \item Binary constraints:

    \[
    islocated_{k, l} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall k \in K, \forall l \in L
    \]
\end{itemize}

\section*{Output Format}

The solution will provide the locations for each department in the following format:

\[
\text{islocated} = [[islocated_{k, l} \text{ for } l \in 1,...,L] \text{ for } k \in 1,...,K]
\]

\section*{Sets}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $K$: Set of departments, where $k \in K$.
    \item $L$: Set of cities, where $l \in L$.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $benefit_{k, l}$: Benefit for department $k$ from relocation at city $l$ (in thousands of pounds).
    \item $communication_{k, j}$: Quantity of communication between department $k$ and department $j$.
    \item $cost_{l, m}$: Unit cost of communication between city $l$ and city $m$.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Decision Variables}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $islocated_{k, l}$: Binary variable that equals 1 if department $k$ is relocated to city $l$, and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Objective Function}

Minimize the overall yearly cost, which can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad Z = \sum_{k \in K} \sum_{l \in L} \left( \text{cost of communication} + \text{benefit from relocation} \right)
\]

Where the cost of communication can be determined as follows:

\[
\sum_{j \in K} \sum_{m \in L} communication_{k, j} \cdot cost_{l, m} \cdot islocated_{j, m}
\]

Thus, the objective function can be rewritten as:

\[
Z = \sum_{k \in K} \sum_{l \in L} \left( \sum_{j \in K} \sum_{m \in L} communication_{k, j} \cdot cost_{l, m} \cdot islocated_{j, m} \right) - \sum_{k \in K} \sum_{l \in L} benefit_{k, l} \cdot islocated_{k, l}
\]

\section*{Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Each department must be located in exactly one city:

    \[
    \sum_{l \in L} islocated_{k, l} = 1, \quad \forall k \in K
    \]

    \item A city can accommodate at most three departments:

    \[
    \sum_{k \in K} islocated_{k, l} \leq 3, \quad \forall l \in L
    \]

    \item Binary constraints:

    \[
    islocated_{k, l} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall k \in K, \forall l \in L
    \]
\end{itemize}

\section*{Output Format}

The solution will provide the locations for each department in the following format:

\[
\text{islocated} = [[islocated_{k, l} \text{ for } l \in 1,...,L] \text{ for } k \in 1,...,K]
\]
