\section*{Mathematical Model for Rocket Trajectory}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The discrete-time model is defined by the following equations:

\begin{align}
x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \tag{1} \\
v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t. \tag{2}
\end{align}

The acceleration \( a_t \) is under our control, which is influenced by the rocket thrust. The magnitude of the acceleration \( |a_t| \) can be related to fuel consumption.

Given the initial conditions:

\[
x_0 \quad \text{(initial position)}
\]
\[
v_0 \quad \text{(initial velocity)}
\]

We aim for the rocket to reach a target position \( x_T \) with speed \( v_T \) at time \( T \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}

Our objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, expressed as:

\[
\min \max_{t = 0, \ldots, T} |a_t|. \tag{3}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

We need to satisfy the following constraints at time \( T \):

1. Position constraint:
\[
x_T = x_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} v_t \tag{4}
\]

2. Velocity constraint:
\[
v_T = v_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} a_t. \tag{5}
\]

3. Acceleration limits (if any):
\[
|a_t| \leq A \quad \text{for all } t, \tag{6}
\]
where \( A \) is the maximum allowable acceleration.

\subsection*{Decision Variables}

The decision variables for this problem are:
\[
\begin{align*}
a_t & \quad \text{(acceleration at time } t\text{)} \\
x_t & \quad \text{(position at time } t\text{)} \\
v_t & \quad \text{(velocity at time } t\text{)}
\end{align*}
\]

\subsection*{Output Format}

The output will consist of:

\begin{align*}
\text{"x"} & = [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T] \\
\text{"v"} & = [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T] \\
\text{"a"} & = [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T] \\
\text{"fuel\_spend"} & = \text{total fuel spent}
\end{align*}
