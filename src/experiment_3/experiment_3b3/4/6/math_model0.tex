\section*{Rocket Movement Optimization Problem}

We define the following variables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_t \): Position of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( v_t \): Velocity of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( a_t \): Acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \)
\end{itemize}

The discrete-time model can be described as follows:
\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]
\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

The objective of our problem is to minimize the total fuel consumption, which is expressed as:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

Subject to the constraints:
\begin{align*}
x_0 &= \text{initial position} \\
v_0 &= \text{initial velocity} \\
x_T &= \text{target position} \\
v_T &= \text{target velocity} \\
T &= \text{total time}
\end{align*}

The output of the optimization problem is structured as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x \): List of positions of the rocket at each time step from \( 0 \) to \( T \)
    \item \( v \): List of velocities of the rocket at each time step from \( 0 \) to \( T \)
    \item \( a \): List of accelerations of the rocket at each time step from \( 0 \) to \( T \)
    \item \text{fuel\_spend}: Total fuel spent by the rocket
\end{itemize}

The expected output format is:
\[
\{
    "x": [x_i \text{ for } i \text{ in } 1, ..., T],
    "v": [v_i \text{ for } i \text{ in } 1, ..., T],
    "a": [a_i \text{ for } i \text{ in } 1, ..., T],
    "fuel\_spend": \text{fuel\_spent},
\}
\]
