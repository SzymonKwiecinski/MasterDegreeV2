PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

\section*{Mathematical Model for Delivery Person's Path Optimization}

\subsection*{Problem Definition}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( N \) be the total number of streets (north direction).
    \item \( W \) be the total number of avenues (west direction).
    \item \( west\_time_{n,w} \) represent the time to walk from intersection \((w, n)\) to \((w+1, n)\).
    \item \( north\_time_{n,w} \) represent the time to walk from intersection \((w, n)\) to \((w, n+1)\).
\end{itemize}

The objective is to minimize the total travel time for the delivery person from the point \((1, 1)\) to \((W, N)\).

\subsection*{Decision Variables}

Define binary decision variables:
\[
x_{w,n} = 
\begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if the path goes west from } (w,n) \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
\[
y_{w,n} = 
\begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if the path goes north from } (w,n) \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\subsection*{Objective Function}

The objective is to minimize the total travel time:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} (west\_time_{n,w} \cdot x_{w,n} + north\_time_{n,w} \cdot y_{w,n})
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. Movement Constraints:
    \begin{align*}
    \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} x_{w,n} + y_{w,n} & = 1 \quad \forall w \in [1, W-1] \text{ (Each intersection must have one outgoing path)} \\
    \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} x_{w,n} + y_{w,n} & = 1 \quad \forall n \in [1, N-1] \text{ (Each intersection must have one outgoing path)}
    \end{align*}

2. Bounds on Variables:
    \[
    x_{w,n}, y_{w,n} \in \{0, 1\}
    \]

3. Starting and Ending Conditions:
   \[
   \text{The path starts at } (1, 1) \text{ and ends at } (W, N)
   \]

\subsection*{Output}

The output will include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total travel time represented as \( total\_time \).
    \item Paths taken represented as \( paths = \{(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) \text{ for } id = 1,..., m\} \).
\end{itemize}
