PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Delivery Path Optimization}

\subsection*{Problem Definition}
A delivery person needs to find the optimal path from the intersection of \textbf{1st Avenue} and \textbf{1st Street} to the intersection of \textbf{Wth Avenue} and \textbf{Nth Street} on an \((N-1) \times (W-1)\) grid, where each block has associated walking times.

\subsection*{Parameters}
Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( N \): Total number of streets (rows).
    \item \( W \): Total number of avenues (columns).
    \item \( west_{n,w} \): Time to move west from intersection \((w,n)\) to \((w+1,n)\).
    \item \( north_{n,w} \): Time to move north from intersection \((w,n)\) to \((w,n+1)\).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Define \( x_{n,w} \) as the binary variable which equals 1 if the delivery person travels through the intersection \((w,n)\), and 0 otherwise.

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total travel time:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} \left( west_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w} + north_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w} \right)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. Flow Conservation Constraints:
    \[
    \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} x_{1,w} = 1 \quad \text{(Start at (1,1))}
    \]
    \[
    \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} x_{n,W-1} = 1 \quad \text{(End at (W,N))}
    \]

2. Movement Constraints:
    \[
    x_{n,w} = x_{n,w+1} + x_{n+1,w} \quad \forall n, w \text{ (ensures paths are connected)}
    \]
    
3. Binary Constraints:
    \[
    x_{n,w} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall n \in \{1,\ldots,N-1\}, w \in \{1,\ldots,W-1\}
    \]

\subsection*{Output}
The solution will provide:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{paths}: A list of intersections \((street_{n}, avenue_{w})\) representing the flow.
    \item \textbf{total\_time}: The total time taken to travel the determined path.
\end{itemize}

#### Data from JSON
data = {'west_time': [[3.5, 4.5], [4, 4], [5, 4]], 'north_time': [[10, 10, 9], [9, 9, 12]]}

#### Dimensions
N = len(data['north_time']) + 1  #### Assuming north_time represents rows minus 1
W = len(data['west_time'][0]) + 1  #### Assuming west_time represents columns minus 1

#### Define the Linear Programming problem

#### Decision variables
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("x", ((n, w) for n in range(1, N) for w in range(1, W)), cat='Binary')

#### Objective function

#### Flow Conservation Constraints
problem += pulp.lpSum(x[(1, w)] for w in range(1, W)) == 1  #### Start at (1,1)
problem += pulp.lpSum(x[(n, W-1)] for n in range(1, N)) == 1  #### End at (W,N)

#### Binary Constraints are inherent in the variable definition

This script defines a linear programming problem to find the optimal delivery path on a grid, using the Pulp library. It reads the walking times from JSON data, sets up decision variables, and creates an objective function to minimize the travel time. It enforces constraints for flow conservation, path connectivity, and binary restrictions. The solution gives the necessary path and the minimal time.
