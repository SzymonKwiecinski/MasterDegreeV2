\section*{Linear Programming Model for Line Fitting}

Let \( y_k \) be the observed values of \( y \) for \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, K \) and \( x_k \) be the corresponding values of \( x \).

We need to fit the line defined by the equation:

\[
y = bx + a
\]

where \( b \) is the slope and \( a \) is the intercept. Our goal is to minimize the maximum deviation of the observed values from the predicted values.

We define the deviation for each observation as follows:

\[
d_k = y_k - (bx_k + a)
\]

The objective is to minimize the maximum deviation, which can be formulated as:

\[
\text{Minimize } M
\]

subject to:

\[
y_k - (bx_k + a) \leq M, \quad \forall k = 1, 2, \ldots, K
\]
\[
-(y_k - (bx_k + a)) \leq M, \quad \forall k = 1, 2, \ldots, K
\]

The full mathematical model can be described using the following linear programming formulation:

\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize} \quad & M \\
\text{subject to} \quad & y_k - bx_k - a \leq M, \quad k = 1, 2, \ldots, K \\
& -y_k + bx_k + a \leq M, \quad k = 1, 2, \ldots, K \\
& \text{where } b \text{ is the slope, } a \text{ is the intercept, and } M \text{ is the maximum deviation.}
\end{align*}

\textbf{Output:}

The solution of the above LP will give us the values of \textit{intercept} \( a \) and \textit{slope} \( b \).

\[
\text{Output: } \{ \text{"intercept"}: a, \text{"slope"}: b \}
\]
