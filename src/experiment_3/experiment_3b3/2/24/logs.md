PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A mining company is going to continue operating in a certain area for the next years. 
- There are \var{n_mines} mines in this area, but it can operate at most \var{n_maxwork} in any one year. 
- Although a mine may not operate in a certain year, it is still necessary to keep it ‘open’, in the sense that royalties are payable, if it be operated in a future year. 
- Clearly, if a mine is not going to be worked again, it can be permanently closed down and no more royalties need be paid. 
- The yearly royalties payable on each mine kept ‘open’ is \var{royalty_{k}} for mine \var{k}.
- There is an upper limit to the amount of ore, which can be extracted from each mine in a year. 
- The upper limit for mine \var{k} is \var{limit_{k}}.
- The ore from the different mines is of varying quality.
- This quality is measured on a scale so that blending ores together results in a linear combination of the quality measurements, for example, if equal quantities of two ores were combined, the resultant ore would have a quality measurement half way between
that of the ingredient ores. 
- The quality of ore from mine \var{k} is \var{quality_{k}}.
- In each year, it is necessary to combine the total outputs from each mine to produce a blended ore of exactly some stipulated quality.
- In year \var{i}, the required quality is \var{requiredquality_{i}}.
- The final blended ore sells for \var{price} ton each year. 
- Revenue and expenditure for future years must be discounted at a rate of \var{discount} per annum.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "n_mines": n_mines,
    "n_maxwork": n_maxwork,

OBJECTIVE: To maximize profit, which mines should be operated each year and how much should they produce?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{isoperated} represents whether each mine is operated in each year

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "isoperated": [[isoperated_{k, i} for i in 1,...,I] for k in 1,...K]

\section*{Problem Definition}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( n_mines \): total number of mines
    \item \( n_{maxwork} \): maximum number of mines that can be operated in any one year
    \item \( royalty_k \): yearly royalties payable for mine \( k \)
    \item \( limit_k \): upper limit of ore that can be extracted from mine \( k \) in a year
    \item \( quality_k \): quality of ore from mine \( k \)
    \item \( requiredquality_i \): required quality of blended ore in year \( i \)
    \item \( price \): selling price per ton of blended ore
    \item \( discount \): discount rate per annum
\end{itemize}

\section*{Decision Variables}
Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( isoperated_{k,i} \): binary variable, 1 if mine \( k \) is operated in year \( i \), 0 otherwise
    \item \( amount_{k,i} \): amount of ore produced by mine \( k \) in year \( i \)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Objective Function}
Maximize the profit, which can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{i=1}^{I} \left( \frac{price \times \sum_{k=1}^{n_{mines}} amount_{k,i}}{(1 + discount)^i} - \sum_{k=1}^{n_{mines}} royalty_k \times isoperated_{k,i} \right)
\]

\section*{Constraints}
1. **Mine Operation Constraint:**
   \[
   \sum_{k=1}^{n_{mines}} isoperated_{k,i} \leq n_{maxwork}, \quad \forall i
   \]

2. **Ore Production Limits:**
   \[
   amount_{k,i} \leq limit_k \times isoperated_{k,i}, \quad \forall k, i
   \]

3. **Quality Constraint:**
   The blended quality of the ore produced must match the required quality:
   \[
   \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n_{mines}} quality_k \times amount_{k,i}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n_{mines}} amount_{k,i}} = requiredquality_i, \quad \forall i
   \]

4. **Non-negativity and Binary Constraints:**
   \[
   amount_{k,i} \geq 0, \quad \forall k, i
   \]
   \[
   isoperated_{k,i} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall k, i
   \]

\section*{Output Format}
The decision variables will be represented in the following output format:
\[
\text{Output} = \left\{ 
\begin{array}{ll}
    "isoperated": & [[isoperated_{k,i} \text{ for } i = 1,...,I] \text{ for } k = 1,...,K] \\
    "amount": & [[amount_{k,i} \text{ for } i = 1,...,I] \text{ for } k = 1,...,K]
