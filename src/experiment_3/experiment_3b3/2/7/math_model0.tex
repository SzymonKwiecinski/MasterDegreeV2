\section*{Rocket Trajectory Optimization Model}

We define the variables involved in the problem:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( x_t \) be the position of the rocket at time \( t \).
    \item Let \( v_t \) be the velocity of the rocket at time \( t \).
    \item Let \( a_t \) be the acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \).
    \item The initial position and velocity are given as \( x_0 \) and \( v_0 \).
    \item The target position and velocity at time \( T \) are given as \( x_T \) and \( v_T \).
\end{itemize}

The dynamical equations governing the motion of the rocket are given by:

\[
\begin{aligned}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t.
\end{aligned}
\]

The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is represented as:

\[
\text{minimize} \quad \max_{t} |a_t|.
\]

Subject to the following constraints for \( t = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, T-1 \):

\[
\begin{aligned}
    x_0 &= x_0, \\
    v_0 &= v_0, \\
    x_T &= x_T, \\
    v_T &= v_T, \\
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t.
\end{aligned}
\]

The total fuel spent, denoted as \( \text{fuel\_spent} \), is proportional to the total acceleration applied, which can be represented as:

\[
\text{fuel\_spent} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|.
\]

The expected output format after solving the optimization problem will be:

\[
\{
    x: [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T],
    v: [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T],
    a: [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T],
    fuel\_spend: \text{fuel\_spent},
\}
\]
