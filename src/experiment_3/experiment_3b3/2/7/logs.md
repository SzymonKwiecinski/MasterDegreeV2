PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "x_0": x_0,
    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,
    "T": T
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is max_t |a_t|. 

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "fuel_spend" contains the total fuel spent by the rocket

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "v": [v_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "a": [a_i for i in 1, ..., T],

We define the variables involved in the problem:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( x_t \) be the position of the rocket at time \( t \).
    \item Let \( v_t \) be the velocity of the rocket at time \( t \).
    \item Let \( a_t \) be the acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \).
    \item The initial position and velocity are given as \( x_0 \) and \( v_0 \).
    \item The target position and velocity at time \( T \) are given as \( x_T \) and \( v_T \).
\end{itemize}

The dynamical equations governing the motion of the rocket are given by:

\[
\begin{aligned}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t.
\end{aligned}
\]

The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is represented as:

\[
\text{minimize} \quad \max_{t} |a_t|.
\]

Subject to the following constraints for \( t = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, T-1 \):

\[
\begin{aligned}
    x_0 &= x_0, \\
    v_0 &= v_0, \\
    x_T &= x_T, \\
    v_T &= v_T, \\
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t.
\end{aligned}
\]

The total fuel spent, denoted as \( \text{fuel\_spent} \), is proportional to the total acceleration applied, which can be represented as:

\[
\text{fuel\_spent} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|.
\]

The expected output format after solving the optimization problem will be:

\[
\{
    x: [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T],
    v: [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T],
    a: [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T],
    fuel\_spend: \text{fuel\_spent},
\}
