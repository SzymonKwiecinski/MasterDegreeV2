PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

\section*{Rocket Motion Model}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. We can describe the motion of the rocket using the following discrete-time equations:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t
\end{align}

We assume that the acceleration \( a_t \) is controllable, meaning that it is determined by the rocket's thrust. The magnitude of the acceleration, \( |a_t| \), is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \( t \).

Given the initial conditions:

\begin{align*}
    x_0 &: \text{initial position} \\
    v_0 &: \text{initial velocity}
\end{align*}

and the desired final conditions:

\begin{align*}
    x_T &: \text{target position} \\
    v_T &: \text{target velocity} \\
    T &: \text{final time}
\end{align*}

We want to minimize the total fuel consumption given by the objective function:

\[
\text{Objective: } \min \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

subject to the constraints:

\begin{align}
    x_0 & \text{ is the initial position} \\
    v_0 & \text{ is the initial velocity} \\
    x_T & \text{ is the target position} \\
    v_T & \text{ is the target velocity} \\
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
\end{align}

The output of this model will contain the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x \): a list of positions at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( v \): a list of velocities at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( a \): a list of accelerations at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( \text{fuel\_spend} \): the total fuel spent by the rocket
\end{itemize}

The expected output format will be:

\[
\text{Output: } \{
    "x": [x_i \text{ for } i = 1, \ldots, T],
    "v": [v_i \text{ for } i = 1, \ldots, T],
    "a": [a_i \text{ for } i = 1, \ldots, T],
    "fuel\_spend": \text{fuel\_spent},
