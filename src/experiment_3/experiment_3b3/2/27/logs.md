PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"benefit": [[benefit_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...,K],
	"communication": [[communication_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
	"cost": [[cost_{l, m} for m in 1,...,L] for l in 1,...,L],
}


OBJECTIVE: Where should each department be located so as to minimize overall yearly cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{islocated_{k, l}} represents whether department \var{k} is relocated at city \var{l}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "islocated": [[islocated_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...K],
}

\section*{Mathematical Model for Department Relocation}

\subsection*{Sets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( K \) be the set of departments, indexed by \( k \).
    \item Let \( L \) be the set of possible cities for relocation, indexed by \( l \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{benefit}_{k,l} \): Benefit for department \( k \) from relocation at city \( l \) (in thousands of pounds).
    \item \( \text{communication}_{k,j} \): Quantity of communication between department \( k \) and department \( j \).
    \item \( \text{cost}_{l,m} \): Unit cost of communication between city \( l \) and city \( m \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define binary variable \( \text{islocated}_{k,l} \) such that:
    \[
    \text{islocated}_{k,l} =
    \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if department } k \text{ is located at city } l \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the overall yearly cost, which can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k \in K} \sum_{l \in L} \left( \text{benefit}_{k,l} \cdot \text{islocated}_{k,l} - \sum_{j \in K} \text{communication}_{k,j} \cdot \sum_{m \in L} \text{cost}_{l,m} \cdot \text{islocated}_{j,m} \right)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. Each department must be located in exactly one city:
\[
\sum_{l \in L} \text{islocated}_{k,l} = 1 \quad \forall k \in K
\]

2. No city can have more than three departments:
\[
\sum_{k \in K} \text{islocated}_{k,l} \leq 3 \quad \forall l \in L
\]

3. Ensuring binary nature of decision variables:
\[
\text{islocated}_{k,l} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall k \in K, \, l \in L
\]
