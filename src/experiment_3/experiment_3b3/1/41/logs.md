PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

\section*{Problem Definition}

We want to minimize the number of floppy disks used to back up important files, given the size of each file and the capacity of the disks.

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $C$: Capacity of each floppy disk (in GB)
    \item $N$: Number of files
    \item $size_j$: Size of file $j$ (for $j = 1, \ldots, N$)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $d_k$: Binary variable, $d_k = 1$ if disk $k$ is used, $0$ otherwise
    \item $x_{jk}$: Binary variable, $x_{jk} = 1$ if file $j$ is placed on disk $k$, $0$ otherwise
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total number of disks used:
\[
\text{Minimize } n_{disks} = \sum_{k=1}^{M} d_k
\]
where $M$ is the maximum number of disks we can potentially use.

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. Each file must be assigned to exactly one disk:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{M} x_{jk} = 1 \quad \forall j \in \{1, \ldots, N\}
\]

2. The total size of the files on each disk must not exceed its capacity:
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{N} size_j \cdot x_{jk} \leq C \cdot d_k \quad \forall k \in \{1, \ldots, M\}
\]

3. A disk can only be marked as used if at least one file is assigned to it:
\[
d_k \geq x_{jk} \quad \forall j \in \{1, \ldots, N\}, \forall k \in \{1, \ldots, M\}
\]

4. Binary constraints:
\[
x_{jk} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad d_k \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall j, k
\]

\subsection*{Outputs}
The outputs of the model will be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n_{disks}$: Total number of floppy disks used
    \item $whichdisk$: An array indicating on which disk each file is distributed
\end{itemize}
