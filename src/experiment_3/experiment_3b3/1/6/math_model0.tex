\section*{Rocket Motion Optimization Model}

We consider a rocket that travels along a straight path, where the position, velocity, and acceleration at time $t$ are denoted by $x_t$, $v_t$, and $a_t$, respectively. The motion of the rocket can be described with the following discrete-time equations:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t.
\end{align}

The acceleration $a_t$ is controlled by the thrust of the rocket and we assume that the magnitude of the acceleration, denoted as $|a_t|$, is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time $t$. 

Given the initial position $x_0$ and velocity $v_0$, our goal is to reach a target position $x_T$ with speed $v_T$ at time $T$. Additionally, we aim to minimize the fuel consumption over the time interval from $0$ to $T-1$.

\subsection*{Variables}
\begin{align*}
& x_t: \text{Position of the rocket at time } t \\
& v_t: \text{Velocity of the rocket at time } t \\
& a_t: \text{Acceleration of the rocket at time } t \\
& T: \text{Total time steps} \\
& x_0, v_0: \text{Initial position and velocity} \\
& x_T, v_T: \text{Target position and velocity}
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to minimize the total fuel consumed, represented as:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
To satisfy the motion dynamics and the initial and final conditions, the following constraints must be enforced:

1. Initial conditions:
   \[
   x_0 \text{ and } v_0 \text{ are given.}
   \]
   
2. Final conditions:
   \[
   x_T = \text{target position } x_T,
   \]
   \[
   v_T = \text{target velocity } v_T.
   \]

3. Motion dynamics:
   For all $t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1$,
   \begin{align*}
   x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \\
   v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t.
   \end{align*}

\subsection*{Solution Output}
The solution will yield the following output format:

\begin{align*}
\{
    & "x": [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T], \\
    & "v": [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T], \\
    & "a": [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T], \\
    & "fuel\_spend": \text{total fuel spent}
\}
\end{align*}
