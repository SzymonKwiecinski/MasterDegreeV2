PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Suppose that there are \var{N} available currencies, and assume that one unit of currency \var{i} can be exchanged for \var{rate_{i,j}} units of currency \var{j} (Naturally, we assume that \var{rate_{i,j}} > 0).
- There are also certain regulations that impose a limit \var{limit_i} on the total amount of currency \var{i} that can be exchanged (whether to other currencies or from other currencies) on any given day.
- Suppose that we start the day with \var{start_i} units of currency \var{i}
- Provide a linear programming formulation of this problem. Assume that for any sequence \var{i_1}, â€¦ ,\var{i_k} of currencies, we have \var{rate_{i_1,i_2}}, \var{rate_{i_2,i_3}}, ..., \var{rate_{i_{k-1}, i_{k}}, \var{rate_{i_k, i_1}} <= 1, which means that wealth cannot be multiplied by going through a cycle of currencies.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "start": [start_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "limit": [limit_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "rate": [[rate_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., N] for i in 1, ..., N],
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to maximize the number of units of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day, through a sequence of currency transactions.

OUTPUT INFO: 

- The output json file contains a list of transactions, where each transaction is a json object with the following fields:
    - from: the currency that we are exchanging from
    - to: the currency that we are exchanging to
    - amount: the amount of currency that we are exchanging
- The output json file also contains the final amount of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day.

OUTPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": i,
            "to": j,
            "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
    ],
    "final_amount_of_currency_N": final_amount_of_currency_N

\title{Linear Programming Formulation for Currency Exchange}
\author{}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Introduction}
We aim to formulate a linear programming model to maximize the total amount of currency \(N\) at the end of the day through a series of transactions, adhering to specified exchange rates and limits on currency exchange.

\section*{Variables}
Let \(x_{i,j}\) represent the amount of currency \(i\) exchanged for currency \(j\) during the day.

\section*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(N\): Total number of available currencies.
    \item \(start_i\): Initial amount of currency \(i\) at the beginning of the day.
    \item \(limit_i\): Maximum amount of currency \(i\) that can be exchanged.
    \item \(rate_{i,j}\): Exchange rate from currency \(i\) to currency \(j\) (where \(rate_{i,j} > 0\)).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Objective Function}
The objective is to maximize the total amount of currency \(N\) we end up with at the end of the day:

\[
\text{Maximize } z = \text{final amount of currency } N
\]

\section*{Constraints}
1. **Limit Constraints**: For each currency \(i\),
   \[
   \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} \leq limit_i \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
   \]

2. **Initial Amount Constraints**: The amount of currency \(i\) available for exchange must satisfy:
   \[
   start_i - \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} + \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{j,i} = \text{final amount of currency } i \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
   \]

3. **Non-Negativity Constraints**: The amounts exchanged must be non-negative:
   \[
   x_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \forall i,j = 1, \ldots, N
   \]

4. **Wealth Preservation Constraints**: Ensuring that wealth cannot be multiplied through cycles:
   \[
   rate_{i_1,i_2} \cdot rate_{i_2,i_3} \cdots rate_{i_k,i_1} \leq 1 \quad \text{for any cycle } (i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k)
   \]

\section*{Conclusion}
With this formulation, we can apply linear programming techniques to derive the optimal transactions among the currencies that will yield the highest amount of currency \(N\) at the end of the day while respecting the given constraints.

```python
import pulp

#### Input data
data = {
    'N': 3, 
    'Start': [100.0, 50.0, 200.0], 
    'Limit': [1000.0, 200.0, 3000.0], 
    'Rate': [
        [0.99, 0.9, 1.02], 
        [0.95, 0.99, 0.92], 
        [0.9, 0.91, 0.99]
    ]
}

#### Define the LP problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Currency_Exchange_Maximization", pulp.LpMaximize)

#### Decision variables
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("exchange", [(i, j) for i in range(data['N']) for j in range(data['N'])], lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')

#### Objective function: Maximize the final amount of currency N
#### Since we are interested in ending up with the maximum amount of currency N (last currency in the list)
problem += data['Start'][-1] - sum(x[i, data['N']-1] for i in range(data['N'])) + sum(data['Rate'][j][data['N']-1] * x[j, data['N']-1] for j in range(data['N']))

#### Constraints
#### 1. Limit Constraints
for i in range(data['N']):
    problem += sum(x[i, j] for j in range(data['N'])) <= data['Limit'][i]

#### 2. Initial Amount Constraints
for i in range(data['N']):
    problem += data['Start'][i] - sum(x[i, j] for j in range(data['N'])) + sum(x[j, i] for j in range(data['N'])) == data['Start'][i]

#### 3. Non-Negativity Constraints are already ensured by 'lowBound=0' in the LpVariable

#### 4. Wealth Preservation Constraints (Checking simple cycles is a heuristic approach, not implemented here)

#### Solve the problem
