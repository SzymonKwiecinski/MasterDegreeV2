\section*{Mathematical Model for Rocket Trajectory Optimization}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The dynamics of the system can be described by the following discrete-time equations:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]

\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which can be expressed as:

\[
\text{minimize } \max_{t} |a_t|
\]

We are subject to the following constraints:

\begin{align*}
x_0 & = \text{initial position} \\
v_0 & = \text{initial velocity} \\
x_T & = \text{target position at time } T \\
v_T & = \text{target velocity at time } T \\
T   & = \text{total time}
\end{align*}

The optimization problem can be formulated as follows:

\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize} & \quad M \\
\text{Subject to:} & \\
x_{t+1} & = x_t + v_t \quad \forall t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T-1\} \\
v_{t+1} & = v_t + a_t \quad \forall t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T-1\} \\
|a_t| & \leq M \quad \forall t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T-1\} \\
x_0 & = x_0 \\
v_0 & = v_0 \\
x_T & = x_T \\
v_T & = v_T
\end{align*}

The output of the model consists of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A list of positions:
    \[
    x = [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T]
    \]
    \item A list of velocities:
    \[
    v = [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T]
    \]
    \item A list of accelerations:
    \[
    a = [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T]
    \]
    \item Total fuel spent:
    \[
    \text{fuel\_spend} = \text{total fuel consumed}
    \]
\end{itemize}
