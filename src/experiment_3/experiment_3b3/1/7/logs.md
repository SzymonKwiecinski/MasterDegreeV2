PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT:

    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,
    "T": T
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is max_t |a_t|. 

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "fuel_spend" contains the total fuel spent by the rocket

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The dynamics of the system can be described by the following discrete-time equations:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]

\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which can be expressed as:

\[
\text{minimize } \max_{t} |a_t|
\]

We are subject to the following constraints:

\begin{align*}
x_0 & = \text{initial position} \\
v_0 & = \text{initial velocity} \\
x_T & = \text{target position at time } T \\
v_T & = \text{target velocity at time } T \\
T   & = \text{total time}
\end{align*}

The optimization problem can be formulated as follows:

\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize} & \quad M \\
\text{Subject to:} & \\
x_{t+1} & = x_t + v_t \quad \forall t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T-1\} \\
v_{t+1} & = v_t + a_t \quad \forall t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T-1\} \\
|a_t| & \leq M \quad \forall t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T-1\} \\
x_0 & = x_0 \\
v_0 & = v_0 \\
x_T & = x_T \\
v_T & = v_T
\end{align*}

The output of the model consists of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A list of positions:
    \[
    x = [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T]
    \]
    \item A list of velocities:
    \[
    v = [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T]
    \]
    \item A list of accelerations:
    \[
    a = [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T]
    \]
    \item Total fuel spent:
    \[
    \text{fuel\_spend} = \text{total fuel consumed}
    \]
