\section*{Rocket Motion Optimization Problem}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The discrete-time model is given by:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]
\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

We assume that the acceleration \( a_t \) is under our control and is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \( t \). We aim to reach a target position \( x_T \) with a target velocity \( v_T \) at time \( T \), starting from initial conditions \( x_0 \) and \( v_0 \).

\subsection*{Input Parameters}

The input to the problem consists of the following parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_0 \): Initial position of the rocket
    \item \( v_0 \): Initial velocity of the rocket
    \item \( x_T \): Target position at time \( T \)
    \item \( v_T \): Target velocity at time \( T \)
    \item \( T \): Total time steps
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}

The objective is to minimize the total fuel spent, represented as:

\[
\text{Minimize } F = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

We must satisfy the following constraints:

1. Position constraint:
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   x_1 & = x_0 + v_0 \\
   x_2 & = x_1 + v_1 \\
   & \vdots \\
   x_T & = x_{T-1} + v_{T-1} 
   \end{aligned}
   \]
   
2. Velocity constraint:
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   v_1 & = v_0 + a_0 \\
   v_2 & = v_1 + a_1 \\
   & \vdots \\
   v_T & = v_{T-1} + a_{T-1}
   \end{aligned}
   \]
   
3. Final conditions:
   \[
   x_T = x_T \quad \text{and} \quad v_T = v_T
   \]

\subsection*{Output Format}

The output should include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \mathbf{x} = [x_i \text{ for } i = 1, \ldots, T] \)
    \item \( \mathbf{v} = [v_i \text{ for } i = 1, \ldots, T] \)
    \item \( \mathbf{a} = [a_i \text{ for } i = 1, \ldots, T] \)
    \item \( \text{fuel\_spend} = F \)
\end{itemize}
