PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Suppose that there are \var{N} available currencies, and assume that one unit of currency \var{i} can be exchanged for \var{rate_{i,j}} units of currency \var{j} (Naturally, we assume that \var{rate_{i,j}} > 0).
- There are also certain regulations that impose a limit \var{limit_i} on the total amount of currency \var{i} that can be exchanged (whether to other currencies or from other currencies) on any given day.
- Suppose that we start the day with \var{start_i} units of currency \var{i}
- Provide a linear programming formulation of this problem. Assume that for any sequence \var{i_1}, â€¦ ,\var{i_k} of currencies, we have \var{rate_{i_1,i_2}}, \var{rate_{i_2,i_3}}, ..., \var{rate_{i_{k-1}, i_{k}}, \var{rate_{i_k, i_1}} <= 1, which means that wealth cannot be multiplied by going through a cycle of currencies.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "start": [start_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "limit": [limit_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "rate": [[rate_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., N] for i in 1, ..., N],
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to maximize the number of units of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day, through a sequence of currency transactions.

OUTPUT INFO: 

- The output json file contains a list of transactions, where each transaction is a json object with the following fields:
    - from: the currency that we are exchanging from
    - to: the currency that we are exchanging to
    - amount: the amount of currency that we are exchanging
- The output json file also contains the final amount of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day.

OUTPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": i,
            "to": j,
            "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
    ],
    "final_amount_of_currency_N": final_amount_of_currency_N

\section*{Linear Programming Formulation}

Given the problem, we can formulate the linear programming model as follows:

\subsection*{Variables}
Let \( x_{i,j} \) be the amount of currency \( i \) exchanged for currency \( j \). 

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to maximize the total amount of currency \( N \) at the end of the day. Thus, we need to maximize:
\[
Z = x_{N, N} + \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{N,j}
\]

Where \( x_{N,N} \) represents the currency \( N \) we end with and \(\sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{N,j}\) represents the total units of currency \( N \).

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. **Exchange Limits:** Each currency \( i \) must not exceed its limit:
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} \leq \text{limit}_i \quad \forall i
\]

2. **Initial Currency Availability:** For each currency \( i \), the total exchanged currency cannot exceed what we start with:
\[
x_{i,j} \leq \text{start}_i \quad \forall i,j
\]

3. **Non-negativity Constraints:** All transactions must be non-negative:
\[
x_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \forall i,j
\]

4. **Exchange Rates Compliance:** The amounts exchanged must respect the exchange rates:
\[
x_{i,j} \cdot \text{rate}_{i,j} \leq x_{j,k} \quad \text{for suitable } k \text{ where the sequence is valid}
\]

5. **Wealth Preservation Across Cycles:** 
\[
\text{rate}_{i_1,i_2} \cdot \text{rate}_{i_2,i_3} \cdots \text{rate}_{i_k,i_1} \leq 1 \quad \text{for any cycle } i_1, \ldots, i_k
\]

\subsection*{Summary}
The model thus consists of the objective function to maximize the end amount of currency \( N \) subject to the limits imposed by starting amounts, exchange limits, non-negativity, exchange rates, and wealth preservation constraints.
