PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

    "v_0": v_0,

}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the total fuel \sum_{t=0}^{\var{T}-1} |\var{a_t}| spent subject to the preceding constraints.

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}

\section*{Rocket Motion Optimization Problem}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The equations for the discrete-time model are given by:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]
\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

We have control over the acceleration \( a_t \), which is related to the fuel consumption. The objective is to minimize the total fuel consumed, which is proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the accelerations over the time steps:

\[
\text{Objective: } \min \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

We are given the following initial conditions and target parameters:

- Initial position: \( x_0 \)
- Initial velocity: \( v_0 \)
- Target position: \( x_T \)
- Target velocity: \( v_T \)
- Final time step: \( T \)

The constraints for this optimization problem can be formalized as follows:

- Initial condition constraints:
  \[
  x_0 = x_0, \quad v_0 = v_0
  \]

- State transition constraints for \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \):
  \[
  x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t, \quad v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
  \]

- Terminal condition constraints:
  \[
  x_T = x_T, \quad v_T = v_T
  \]

Thus, to summarize, the optimization problem can be stated as follows:

\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize: } & \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t| \\
\text{Subject to: } & x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
& v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
& x_0 = x_0, \quad v_0 = v_0 \\
& x_T = x_T, \quad v_T = v_T
\end{align*}

The output of the optimization should include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x \): a list of positions at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( v \): a list of velocities at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( a \): a list of accelerations at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( \text{fuel\_spend} \): total fuel spent by the rocket
\end{itemize}

The output format is:

\[
\{ 
    "x": [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "v": [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "a": [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    "fuel\_spend": \text{fuel\_spent}
