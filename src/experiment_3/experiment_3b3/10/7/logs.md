PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

\section*{Rocket Trajectory Optimization Model}

We are considering a rocket traveling along a straight path, governed by the following discrete-time equations:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t
\end{align}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_t \) is the position of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( v_t \) is the velocity of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( a_t \) is the acceleration (thrust) of the rocket at time \( t \) which we control.
\end{itemize}

Given the initial conditions \( x_0 \) and \( v_0 \), we aim to ensure that at time \( T \), the rocket reaches a target position \( x_T \) with speed \( v_T \).

The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, expressed mathematically as:

\[
\text{Minimize } z = \max_{t} |a_t|
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}

The motion constraints for the rocket can be expressed as:

\begin{align}
    x_{T} &= x_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} v_t \\
    v_{T} &= v_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} a_t
\end{align}

\textbf{Inputs:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_0 \): Initial position of the rocket
    \item \( v_0 \): Initial velocity of the rocket
    \item \( x_T \): Target position of the rocket at time \( T \)
    \item \( v_T \): Target velocity of the rocket at time \( T \)
    \item \( T \): Total time steps
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Output:}
The solution should provide the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x \): List of positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( v \): List of velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( a \): List of accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( \text{fuel\_spend} \): Total fuel spent by the rocket
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Output Format:}
\[
\{
    x: [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    v: [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    a: [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    \text{fuel\_spend}: \text{fuel\_spent}

######### Changes Made:
1. The `lowBound` and `upBound` arguments for the variable `a` were modified to use static values `-1` and `1` instead of `pulp.lpSum([1])`, which was causing the TypeError.
2. The `fuel_spend` calculation was changed to correctly compute the absolute values of `a[t]` instead of trying to sum `lpSum` over `a[t]`.

The business logic remains intact, and the objective value is printed as requested.
