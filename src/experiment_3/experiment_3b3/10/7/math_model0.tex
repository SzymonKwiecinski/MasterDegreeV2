\section*{Rocket Trajectory Optimization Model}

We are considering a rocket traveling along a straight path, governed by the following discrete-time equations:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t
\end{align}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_t \) is the position of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( v_t \) is the velocity of the rocket at time \( t \)
    \item \( a_t \) is the acceleration (thrust) of the rocket at time \( t \) which we control.
\end{itemize}

Given the initial conditions \( x_0 \) and \( v_0 \), we aim to ensure that at time \( T \), the rocket reaches a target position \( x_T \) with speed \( v_T \).

The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, expressed mathematically as:

\[
\text{Minimize } z = \max_{t} |a_t|
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}

The motion constraints for the rocket can be expressed as:

\begin{align}
    x_{T} &= x_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} v_t \\
    v_{T} &= v_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} a_t
\end{align}

\textbf{Inputs:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_0 \): Initial position of the rocket
    \item \( v_0 \): Initial velocity of the rocket
    \item \( x_T \): Target position of the rocket at time \( T \)
    \item \( v_T \): Target velocity of the rocket at time \( T \)
    \item \( T \): Total time steps
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Output:}
The solution should provide the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x \): List of positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( v \): List of velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( a \): List of accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \( T \)
    \item \( \text{fuel\_spend} \): Total fuel spent by the rocket
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Output Format:}
\[
\{
    x: [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    v: [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    a: [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T],
    \text{fuel\_spend}: \text{fuel\_spent}
\}
\]
