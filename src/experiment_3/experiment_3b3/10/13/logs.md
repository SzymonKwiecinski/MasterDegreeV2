PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- Consider a set \var{P} described by linear inequality constraints, that is:
 \var{P} = {\var{x} \in R^\var{N} | \var{a_i}^T x <= \var{b_i} , i = 1, ..., m}.

where \var{a_i} \in R^\var{N} and \var{b_i} \in R

- A ball with center \var{y} in R^\var{N} and radius \var{r} is defined as the set of all points within (Euclidean) distance \var{r} from \var{y}.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "A": [[a_i_j for j in 1, ..., n] for i in 1, ..., m],
    "b": [b_i for i in 1, ..., m]
}

OBJECTIVE: We are interested in finding a ball with the largest possible radius, which is entirely contained within the set \var{P} (The center of such a ball is called the Chebychev center of \var{P}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- center (list): The center of the ball as a list of floats of length \var{N}
- radius (float): The radius of the ball as a float

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "center": [y_j for j in 1, ..., n],
    "radius": r
}

\section*{Problem Formulation}

We define the feasible region \( P \) as the set of points \( x \in \mathbb{R}^N \) that satisfy the linear inequality constraints:

\[
P = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^N \mid a_i^T x \leq b_i, \; i = 1, \ldots, m \}
\]

where \( a_i \in \mathbb{R}^N \) and \( b_i \in \mathbb{R} \).

A ball with center \( y \) in \( \mathbb{R}^N \) and radius \( r \) is defined as:

\[
B(y, r) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^N \mid \| x - y \|_2 \leq r \}
\]

Our objective is to find a ball \( B(y, r) \) that is entirely contained within the set \( P \) while maximizing the radius \( r \). The center of such a ball is referred to as the Chebyshev center of the set \( P \).

\subsection*{Input}

The input is provided in the following format:

\begin{verbatim}
{
    "A": [[a_i_j for j in 1, ..., n] for i in 1, ..., m],
    "b": [b_i for i in 1, ..., m]
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Output}

The output should include the center of the ball and the radius, formatted as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
{
    "center": [y_j for j in 1, ..., n],
    "radius": r
}
\end{verbatim}
