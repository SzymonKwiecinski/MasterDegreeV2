PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- The town has \var{S} different shifts for the police officers during the day.
- During each shift \var{s}, the town requires \var{officers_needed_{s}} police officers on duty.
- Each police officer works for two consecutive shifts.
- The cost for the town when starting a shift at \var{s} is \var{shift_cost_{s}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "officers_needed": [officers_needed_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "shift_costs": [shift_cost_{s} for s in 1, ..., S]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many officers should the town assign to each shift in order to minimize the total cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- The number of officers assigned to each shift \var{officers_assigned_{s}}.
- \var{total_cost} indicates the total cost for the town.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "officers_assigned": [officers_assigned_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Police Officer Shift Assignment}

\textbf{Indices:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $s$: index for shifts, where $s = 1, 2, \ldots, S$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $officers\_needed_s$: number of police officers needed during shift $s$
    \item $shift\_cost_s$: cost incurred for starting shift $s$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $officers\_assigned_s$: number of police officers assigned to shift $s$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective Function:}
\begin{equation}
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{s=1}^{S} shift\_cost_s \cdot x_s
\end{equation}

\textbf{Constraints:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For each shift, the number of officers assigned must meet the requirement for that shift:
    \begin{equation}
    officers\_assigned_s \geq officers\_needed_s, \quad \forall s \in \{1, 2, \ldots, S\}
    \end{equation}
    
    \item An officer works for two consecutive shifts, thus the assignment for each shift must be consistent with the officer's duty:
    \begin{equation}
    officers\_assigned_s = officers\_assigned_{s-1} \text{ for } s=2,3,\ldots,S
    \end{equation}
    
    \item Additionally, we can state that the officers assigned for the first shift must cover the need:
    \begin{equation}
    officers\_assigned_1 \geq officers\_needed_1
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Expected Output:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $officers\_assigned = \{officers\_assigned_1, officers\_assigned_2, \ldots, officers\_assigned_S\}$
    \item $total\_cost = Z$
\end{itemize}
