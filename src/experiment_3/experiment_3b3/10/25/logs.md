<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- An economy consists of several industries. 
- Each unit produced by one of the industries (a unit will be taken as £1’s worth of value of production) requires inputs from possibly its own industry as well as other industries. 
- Industry \var{k} requires \var{inputone_{k, j}} input from industy \var{j}.
- Industry \var{k} requires \var{manpowerone_{k}} units of manpower.
- There is a time lag in the economy so that the output in year t + 1 requires an input in year t.
- Output from an industry may also be used to build productive capacity for itself or other industries in future years.
- To give unit increases (capacity for £1’s worth of extra production) in productive capacity of industry \var{k}, \var{j} units of industry \var{inputtwo_{k, j}} and \var{manpowertwo{k}} units of manpower are needed.
- Input from an industry in year t results in a (permanent) increase in productive capacity in year t + 2.
- Stocks of goods may be held from year to year. 
- At present (year 0), the stocks of industry \var{k} is \var{stock_{k}}, and the capacity of industry \var{k} is \var{capacity_{k}}.
- There is a limited yearly manpower capacity of \var{manpower_limit}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "inputone": [[inputone_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
    "manpowerone": [manpowerone_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "inputtwo": [[inputtwo_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
    "manpowertwo": [manpowertwo_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "stock": [stock_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "capacity": [capacity_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "manpower_limit": manpower_limit,
}


OBJECTIVE: Maximize total production in the last two years.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{produce} represents the amount of units produced by each industry in each year
- \var{buildcapa} represents the amount of units used to build productive capacity for each industry in each year
- \var{stockhold} represents the amount of stock of each industry held in each year

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "produce": [[produce_{k, t} for t in 1,...,T] for k in 1,...,K],
    "buildcapa": [[buildcapa_{k, t} for t in 1,...,T] for k in 1,...,K],
    "stockhold": [[stock_{k, t} for t in 1,...,T] for for k in 1,...,K]

\section*{Linear Programming Model for an Economy}

\subsection*{Variables}
Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( produce_{k, t} \): amount of units produced by industry \( k \) in year \( t \)
    \item \( buildcapa_{k, t} \): amount of units used to build productive capacity for industry \( k \) in year \( t \)
    \item \( stock_{k, t} \): amount of stock of industry \( k \) held in year \( t \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
Given \( K \) industries over \( T \) years, we define the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( inputone_{k, j} \): input required from industry \( j \) by industry \( k \)
    \item \( manpowerone_{k} \): units of manpower required by industry \( k \)
    \item \( inputtwo_{k, j} \): input required from industry \( j \) for building capacity of industry \( k \)
    \item \( manpowertwo_{k} \): manpower required by industry \( k \) for building capacity
    \item \( stock_{k} \): initial stock of industry \( k \) at year 0
    \item \( capacity_{k} \): current capacity of industry \( k \)
    \item \( manpower\_limit \): limited yearly manpower capacity
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Maximize the total production in the last two years:

\[
\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \left( produce_{k, T} + produce_{k, T-1} \right)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Production Constraints for Year \( t \):
    \[
    produce_{k, t} \leq stock_{k, t-1} + capacity_{k} \quad \forall k, \forall t = 1, \ldots, T
    \]
    
    \item Inputs Required for Production:
    \[
    \sum_{j=1}^{K} inputone_{k,j} \cdot produce_{j,t-1} + stock_{k,t-1} \geq produce_{k,t} \quad \forall k, \forall t = 1, \ldots, T
    \]

    \item Manpower Limit:
    \[
    \sum_{k=1}^{K} manpowerone_{k} \cdot produce_{k,t} + \sum_{k=1}^{K} manpowertwo_{k} \cdot buildcapa_{k,t} \leq manpower\_limit \quad \forall t = 1, \ldots, T
    \]

    \item Capacity Building Requirements:
    \[
    buildcapa_{k,t} \leq capacity_{k} + \sum_{j=1}^{K} inputtwo_{k,j} \cdot produce_{j,t-2} \quad \forall k, \forall t = 3, \ldots, T
    \]

    \item Stock Balancing:
    \[
    stock_{k,t} = stock_{k,t-1} + produce_{k,t-1} - \sum_{j=1}^{K} inputone_{j,k} \cdot produce_{j,t-1} \quad \forall k, \forall t = 1, \ldots, T
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Output}
The outputs of the model include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( produce \): amount of units produced by each industry in each year
    \item \( buildcapa \): amount of units used to build productive capacity for each industry in each year
    \item \( stockhold \): amount of stock of each industry held in each year
