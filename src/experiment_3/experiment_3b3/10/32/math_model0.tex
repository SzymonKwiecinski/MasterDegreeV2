\section*{Linear Programming Model}
Given a set of products that can be produced through multiple stages, we aim to maximize the profit while adhering to production time constraints. 

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $K$ = total number of products
    \item $S$ = total number of stages
    \item $produce\_time_{k,s}$ = time (in hours) required to produce one unit of product $k$ in stage $s$
    \item $time_s$ = available working hours for stage $s$
    \item $profit_k$ = profit generated from selling one unit of product $k$
    \item $quantity_k$ = quantity of product $k$ produced
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
We want to maximize the total profit, which can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} profit_k \cdot quantity_k
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
The production time for each stage must not exceed the available time. This can be formulated as:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} produce\_time_{k,s} \cdot quantity_k \leq time_s \quad \text{for } s = 1, \ldots, S
\]

Additionally, we have the non-negativity constraints:
\[
quantity_k \geq 0 \quad \text{for } k = 1, \ldots, K
\]

\subsection*{Complete Model}
The complete linear programming formulation can thus be represented as:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Maximize } & Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} profit_k \cdot quantity_k \\
\text{subject to } & \sum_{k=1}^{K} produce\_time_{k,s} \cdot quantity_k \leq time_s, \quad s = 1, \ldots, S \\
& quantity_k \geq 0, \quad k = 1, \ldots, K
\end{align*}
\]
