PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

\section*{Mathematical Model for Rocket Motion}

Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path with the following variables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_t$: Position of the rocket at time $t$.
    \item $v_t$: Velocity of the rocket at time $t$.
    \item $a_t$: Acceleration of the rocket at time $t$.
\end{itemize}

The discretized equations of motion for the rocket can be expressed as:

\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \tag{1} \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t \tag{2}
\end{align}

The acceleration $a_t$ is under our control, determined by the thrust of the rocket. We assume:

\[
|a_t| \propto \text{fuel consumption at time } t \tag{3}
\]

Given the initial conditions:

\begin{align*}
    x_0 & : \text{Initial position} \\
    v_0 & : \text{Initial velocity}
\end{align*}

The goal is to reach a target position $x_T$ with speed $v_T$ at time $T$, while minimizing the maximum thrust required:

\[
\text{Minimize } \max_{t} |a_t| \tag{4}
\]

The output required includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Key "x": A list of positions $[x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_T]$.
    \item Key "v": A list of velocities $[v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_T]$.
    \item Key "a": A list of accelerations $[a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_T]$.
    \item Key "fuel\_spend": Total fuel spent by the rocket.
\end{itemize}

The mathematical description of the output format is:

\[
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Output} &: \{ \\
    &\quad "x": [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T], \\
    &\quad "v": [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T], \\
    &\quad "a": [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T], \\
    &\quad "fuel\_spend": \text{total fuel spent} \\
