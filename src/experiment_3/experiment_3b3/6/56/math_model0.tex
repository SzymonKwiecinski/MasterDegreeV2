\section*{Linear Programming Model for Delivery Path Optimization}

\subsection*{Problem Description}

A delivery person starts at the intersection of the 1st Avenue and 1st Street and needs to reach the intersection of the \(W\)th Avenue and \(N\)th Street on a \( (N-1) \times (W-1) \) grid. The unique walking time for each block is provided due to varying pedestrian traffic.

The delivery person can only move north or west, and the movement is defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The time to move from the intersection of \( (w, n) \) to \( (w+1, n) \) (west) is given by \( \text{west\_time}_{n,w} \).
    \item The time to move from the intersection of \( (w, n) \) to \( (w, n+1) \) (north) is given by \( \text{north\_time}_{n,w} \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}

Let \( x_{n,w} \) be the binary variable defined as follows:
\[
x_{n,w} = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if the delivery person moves from } (w,n) \text{ to } (w,n+1)\\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Let \( y_{n,w} \) be the binary variable defined as follows:
\[
y_{n,w} = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if the delivery person moves from } (w,n) \text{ to } (w+1,n)\\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\subsection*{Objective Function}

The objective is to minimize the total time \( T \) taken to travel from the starting point to the destination:
\[
\text{minimize } T = \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} (x_{n,w} \cdot \text{north\_time}_{n,w} + y_{n,w} \cdot \text{west\_time}_{n,w})
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. The delivery person must arrive at the destination after \( m \) moves:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} x_{N-1,w} + \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} y_{n,W-1} = m
\]

2. The flow conservation at each intersection:
\[
\sum_{w=1}^{W-1} x_{n,w} + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} y_{n,w} = 1 \quad \forall n, w
\]

3. The constraints for \( x_{n,w} \) and \( y_{n,w} \):
\[
x_{n,w}, y_{n,w} \in \{0, 1\}
\]

\subsection*{Output}

The model will provide the following outputs:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{paths}: The series of intersections representing the optimal path taken by the delivery person.
    \item \texttt{total\_time}: The total travel time calculated from the objective function.
\end{itemize}
