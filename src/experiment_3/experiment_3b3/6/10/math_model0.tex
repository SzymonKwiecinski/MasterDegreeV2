\section*{Linear Programming Model for School Assignment Problem}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N$: Number of neighborhoods
    \item $S$: Number of schools
    \item $G$: Number of grades at each school
    \item $capacity_{s,g}$: Capacity of school $s$ for grade $g$
    \item $population_{n,g}$: Student population of grade $g$ in neighborhood $n$
    \item $d_{n,s}$: Distance from neighborhood $n$ to school $s$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let $x_{n,s,g}$ be the number of students of grade $g$ in neighborhood $n$ assigned to school $s$. 

\subsection*{Objective Function}
We want to minimize the total distance traveled by all students:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{s=1}^{S} \sum_{g=1}^{G} d_{n,s} \cdot x_{n,s,g}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. Capacity constraints for each school for each grade:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n,s,g} \leq capacity_{s,g}, \quad \forall s \in \{1, \ldots, S\}, \quad \forall g \in \{1, \ldots, G\}
\]

2. Population constraints for each neighborhood for each grade:
\[
\sum_{s=1}^{S} x_{n,s,g} = population_{n,g}, \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}, \quad \forall g \in \{1, \ldots, G\}
\]

3. Non-negativity constraints:
\[
x_{n,s,g} \geq 0, \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}, \quad \forall s \in \{1, \ldots, S\}, \quad \forall g \in \{1, \ldots, G\}
\]
