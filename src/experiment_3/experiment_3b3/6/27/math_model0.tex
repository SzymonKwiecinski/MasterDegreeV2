\section*{Mathematical Model for Department Relocation}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( islocated_{k, l} = 1 \) if department \( k \) is located in city \( l \); 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( K \): number of departments
    \item \( L \): number of cities
    \item \( benefit_{k, l} \): benefits for department \( k \) from relocation at city \( l \) (in thousands of pounds)
    \item \( communication_{k, j} \): quantity of communication between department \( k \) and department \( j \)
    \item \( cost_{l, m} \): unit cost of communication between city \( l \) and city \( m \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the overall yearly cost, which is defined as the total communication cost minus the benefits from relocation:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{l=1}^L \left( \sum_{j=1}^K communication_{k, j} \cdot cost_{l, m} \cdot islocated_{j, m} \right) - \sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{l=1}^L benefit_{k, l} \cdot islocated_{k, l}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each department can only be located in one city:
    \[
    \sum_{l=1}^L islocated_{k, l} = 1, \quad \forall k \in \{1, \ldots, K\}
    \]

    \item No city can host more than three departments:
    \[
    \sum_{k=1}^K islocated_{k, l} \leq 3, \quad \forall l \in \{1, \ldots, L\}
    \]

    \item The decision variables must be binary:
    \[
    islocated_{k, l} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall k \in \{1, \ldots, K\}, \, l \in \{1, \ldots, L\}
    \]
\end{itemize}
