PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

\section*{Rocket Motion and Fuel Optimization Problem}

We consider a rocket traveling along a straight path, where the variables \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. 
The discrete-time motion model is given by:

\begin{align*}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t.
\end{align*}

We assume that the acceleration \( a_t \) is under our control, determined by the rocket thrust. The magnitude of the acceleration \( |a_t| \) can be approximated to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \( t \).

Given the initial conditions:
- \( x_0 \): Initial position
- \( v_0 \): Initial velocity

We aim to guide the rocket to reach a target position \( x_T \) with a target velocity \( v_T \) at time \( T \). The goal is to minimize the total fuel consumption \( \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t| \).

\subsection*{Input}
The input is represented as:
\[
\begin{align*}
    &\text{Input:} \\

    &\quad v_0, \\
    &\quad x_T, \\
    &\quad v_T, \\
    &\quad T \\
    &\}
\end{align*}
\]

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective function to minimize is:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
The following constraints must be satisfied:
1. \( x_0 \) and \( v_0 \) are given initial conditions.
2. Final conditions at time \( T \):
   \[
   x_T = x_T
   \]
   \[
   v_T = v_T
   \]

3. Evolution constraints:
   \[
   x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t, \quad t=0,1,\ldots,T-1,
   \]
   \[
   v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t, \quad t=0,1,\ldots,T-1.
   \]
