\section*{Linear Programming Model for Linear Regression}

Given the observed values of \( y \) and \( x \):

\[
\{y_k\}_{k=1}^{K}, \quad \{x_k\}_{k=1}^{K}
\]

we want to fit a straight line represented by the equation:

\[
y = bx + a
\]

Our objective is to minimize the maximum deviation of the observed values \( y_k \) from the predicted values \( \hat{y}_k = bx_k + a \). 

To formulate this as a linear programming problem, we introduce a variable \( d_k \) which represents the deviation for each \( k \):

\[
d_k \geq y_k - (bx_k + a) \quad \text{for } k = 1, \ldots, K
\]

\[
d_k \geq (bx_k + a) - y_k \quad \text{for } k = 1, \ldots, K
\]

The objective is to minimize the maximum deviation \( D \):

\[
\text{Minimize } D
\]

subject to the constraints:

\[
d_k \leq D \quad \text{for } k = 1, \ldots, K
\]

The complete set of linear constraints is therefore:

1. \( d_k \geq y_k - (bx_k + a) \) for \( k = 1, \ldots, K \)
2. \( d_k \geq (bx_k + a) - y_k \) for \( k = 1, \ldots, K \)
3. \( d_k \leq D \) for \( k = 1, \ldots, K \)

Additionally, the relationships between \( D \), \( a \), and \( b \) must be defined. Thus, our optimization problem can be summarized as:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize} & \quad D \\
\text{subject to} & \\
& d_k \geq y_k - (bx_k + a) \quad \forall k \\
& d_k \geq (bx_k + a) - y_k \quad \forall k \\
& d_k \leq D \quad \forall k \\
& \text{where } a \text{ is the intercept and } b \text{ is the slope.}
\end{align*}
\]
