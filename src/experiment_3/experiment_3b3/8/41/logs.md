PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

\section*{Mathematical Model for Floppy Disk Backup Problem}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $C$: Capacity of each floppy disk (in GB).
    \item $N$: Number of files to be backed up.
    \item $size_j$: Size of file $j$, for $j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{d}$: Binary variable that equals 1 if disk $d$ is used, 0 otherwise.
    \item $y_{jd}$: Binary variable that equals 1 if file $j$ is placed on disk $d$, 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total number of floppy disks used:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{d=1}^{D} x_d
\]

where $D$ is the maximum number of disks used.

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each file must be assigned to exactly one disk:
    \[
    \sum_{d=1}^{D} y_{jd} = 1, \quad \forall j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}
    \]

    \item The total size of files on a disk cannot exceed its capacity:
    \[
    \sum_{j=1}^{N} size_j \cdot y_{jd} \leq C \cdot x_d, \quad \forall d \in \{1, 2, \ldots, D\}
    \]

    \item Indicate that if a disk is used, at least one file must be on it:
    \[
    y_{jd} \leq x_d, \quad \forall j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}, \; \forall d \in \{1, 2, \ldots, D\}
    \]

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Output}
The output will consist of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n\_disks$: Total number of floppy disks used.
    \item $whichdisk$: An array where $whichdisk_j$ represents the disk on which file $j$ is stored.
\end{itemize}
