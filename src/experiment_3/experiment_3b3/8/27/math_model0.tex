\section*{Mathematical Model for Department Relocation}

\subsection*{Sets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $K$: Set of departments, indexed by $k$.
    \item $L$: Set of possible cities for relocation, indexed by $l$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $benefit_{k, l}$: Benefits for department $k$ from relocation at city $l$ (in thousands of pounds).
    \item $communication_{k, j}$: Quantity of communication between department $k$ and department $j$.
    \item $cost_{l, m}$: Unit cost of communication between city $l$ and city $m$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $islocated_{k, l}$: Binary variable that equals 1 if department $k$ is relocated at city $l$, and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the overall yearly cost:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k \in K} \sum_{l \in L} (benefit_{k, l} \cdot islocated_{k, l}) + \sum_{k \in K} \sum_{j \in K} \sum_{l \in L} \sum_{m \in L} (communication_{k, j} \cdot cost_{l, m} \cdot islocated_{k, l} \cdot islocated_{j, m})
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each department can only be located in one city:
    \[
    \sum_{l \in L} islocated_{k, l} = 1, \quad \forall k \in K
    \]
    
    \item No more than three departments may be located in any city:
    \[
    \sum_{k \in K} islocated_{k, l} \leq 3, \quad \forall l \in L
    \]

    \item Non-negativity and binary constraints:
    \[
    islocated_{k, l} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall k \in K, \forall l \in L
    \]
\end{itemize}
