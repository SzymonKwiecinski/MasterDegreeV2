PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements in future years. 
- Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. 
- In addition to this, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, which will reduce the need for workers in all categories.
- The estimated manpower requirements for manpower \var{k} in year \var{i} is \var{requirement_{k, i}}.
- The current number of manpower \var{k} is \var{strength_{k}}.
- The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to recruitment, retraining, redundancy and short-time working in the next years.
- There is a natural wastage of labour. 
- A fairly large number of workers leave during their first year. After this, the rate of leaving is much smaller. 
- Taking this into account, the wastage rates of manpower \var{k} with less than one year's service is \var{lessonewaste_{k}}.
- The wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with more than one year's service is \var{moreonewaste_{k}}.
- There has been no recent recruitment and all the workers in the current labour force have been employed for more than one year.
- It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. 
- In any one year, the maximum number that can be recruited in manpower \var{k} is \var{recruit_{k}}.
- The redundancy payment to manpower \var{k} is \var{costredundancy_{k}}.
- It is possible to employ up to \var{num_overman} more workers over the whole company than are needed, but the extra costs per employee per year is \var{costoverman_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- Up to \var{num_shortwork} workers in each category of skill can be put on short-time working. 
- The cost of this (per employee per year) is \var{costshort_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of half a full-time employee.

}


OBJECTIVE: The companyâ€™s declared objective is to minimize redundancy. How should they operate in order to do this?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{recruit} represents the number of each recruit manpower to employ each year
- \var{overmanning} represents the number of each overmanning manpower to employ each year
- \var{short} represents the number of each short-time manpower to employ each year

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "recruit": [[recruit_{k, i} for i in 1,...,I] for k in 1,...,K],
    "overmanning": [[overmanning_{k, i} for i in 1,...,I] for k in 1,...,K],

\section*{Problem Statement}
A company is undergoing changes affecting its manpower requirements in future years due to new machinery installation and an expected downturn in trade.

\section*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $K$: Number of manpower categories
    \item $I$: Number of years
    \item $requirement_{k, i}$: Estimated manpower requirement for category $k$ in year $i$
    \item $strength_{k}$: Current number of manpower in category $k$
    \item $lessonewaste_{k}$: Wastage rate for manpower $k$ with less than one year's service
    \item $moreonewaste_{k}$: Wastage rate for manpower $k$ with more than one year's service
    \item $recruit_{k}$: Maximum number of recruits for manpower category $k$ in one year
    \item $costredundancy_{k}$: Redundancy payment for manpower category $k$
    \item $num\_overman$: Maximum number of overmanned workers allowed
    \item $costoverman_{k}$: Extra cost per overmanned employee per year for manpower category $k$
    \item $num\_shortwork$: Maximum number of short-time workers allowed in each category
    \item $costshort_{k}$: Cost of short-time working per employee per year for manpower category $k$
\end{itemize}

\section*{Decision Variables}
Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $recruit_{k, i}$: Number of recruits for manpower category $k$ in year $i$
    \item $overmanning_{k, i}$: Number of overmanned workers for manpower category $k$ in year $i$
    \item $short_{k, i}$: Number of short-time workers for manpower category $k$ in year $i$
\end{itemize}

\section*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total redundancy costs:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{i=1}^{I} costredundancy_{k} \cdot (strength_{k} + recruit_{k, i} - requirement_{k, i} - overmanning_{k, i} - 0.5 \cdot short_{k, i})
\]

\section*{Constraints}
1. Manpower balance:
\[
strength_{k} + recruit_{k, i} - (strength_{k} \cdot (1 - lessonewaste_{k}) \cdot (1 - moreonewaste_{k})) - short_{k, i} \leq requirement_{k, i} + overmanning_{k, i}, \quad \forall k, i
\]
2. Recruitment limit:
\[
recruit_{k, i} \leq recruit_{k}, \quad \forall k, i
\]
3. Overmanning limit:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} overmanning_{k, i} \leq num\_overman, \quad \forall i
\]
4. Short-time working limit:
\[
short_{k, i} \leq num\_shortwork, \quad \forall k, i
\]
5. Non-negativity:
\[
recruit_{k, i} \geq 0, \quad overmanning_{k, i} \geq 0, \quad short_{k, i} \geq 0, \quad \forall k, i
