PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
        for id in 1, ..., m

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Soybean Transportation}

\subsection*{Sets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( A \) be the set of all routes, where each route connects a terminal city \( k \) to a port city \( p \) and then to a destination city \( l \).
    \item Let \( n \) represent the number of cities.
    \item Let \( i \) denote the starting city, \( j \) the ending city (port), and \( l \) the destination city.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( C_{i,j} \): the transportation cost per metric ton along route from city \( i \) to city \( j \).
    \item \( \text{supply}_{k} \): the amount of soybeans available at terminal city \( k \).
    \item \( \text{demand}_{l} \): the amount of soybeans required at destination city \( l \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let \( \text{amount}_{i,j} \) be the quantity of soybeans shipped from city \( i \) to city \( j \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total transportation cost:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \cdot \text{amount}_{i,j}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. Supply Constraints:
\[
\sum_{j} \text{amount}_{k,j} \leq \text{supply}_{k} \quad \forall \, k \, \text{(for all terminal cities)}
\]

2. Demand Constraints:
\[
\sum_{i} \text{amount}_{i,l} \geq \text{demand}_{l} \quad \forall \, l \, \text{(for all destination cities)}
\]

3. Non-negativity Constraints:
\[
\text{amount}_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \forall (i,j) \in A
\]

\subsection*{Output Format}
The output of the model will be:
\begin{verbatim}
{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
