PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- A state wants to plan its electricity capacity for the next \var{T} years. 
- The state has a forecast of \var{demand_t} megawatts, presumed accurate, of the demand for electricity during year \var{t}.
- The existing capacity, which is in oil-fired plants, that will not be retired and will be available during year \var{t}, is \var{oil_t}.
- There are two alternatives for expanding electric capacity: coalÂ­ fired or nuclear power plants.
- There is a capital cost of \var{coal_cost} per megawatt of coal-fired capacity that becomes operational at the beginning of year \var{t}.
- There is a capital cost of \var{nuke_cost} per megawatt of nuclear power capacity that becomes operational at the beginning of year \var{t}.
- For various political and safety reasons, it has been decided that no more than \var{max_nuke}% of the total capacity should ever be nuclear (\var{max_nuke} is a number between 0 and 100).
- Coal plants last for \var{coal_life} years, while nuclear plants last for \var{nuke_life} years.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "demand": [demand_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "oil_cap": [oil_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "coal_cost": coal_cost,
    "nuke_cost": nuke_cost,
    "max_nuke": max_nuke,
    "coal_life": coal_life,
    "nuke_life": nuke_life,
}


OBJECTIVE: What is the capacity expansion plan that results in the minimum cost?


OUTPUT INFO:

- the output should represent how much coal and nuclear capacity should be added in each year, and how much the total cost is.
- the output should be a dictionary with three keys: "coal_cap_added", "nuke_cap_added", and "total_cost".
- the value of "coal_cap_added" should be a list of the coal capacity added in each year.
- the value of "nuke_cap_added" should be a list of the nuclear capacity added in each year.
- the value of "total_cost" should be a single floating point number showing the total cost of the system.


OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "coal_cap_added": [coal_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "nuke_cap_added": [nuke_t for t in 1, ..., T],
    "total_cost": total_cost,
}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T$: Number of years
    \item $demand_t$: Demand for electricity in year $t$ (in megawatts)
    \item $oil_t$: Existing oil capacity available in year $t$ (in megawatts)
    \item $coal\_cost$: Capital cost per megawatt of coal-fired capacity
    \item $nuke\_cost$: Capital cost per megawatt of nuclear power capacity
    \item $max\_nuke$: Maximum percentage of total capacity that can be nuclear
    \item $coal\_life$: Lifespan of coal plants (in years)
    \item $nuke\_life$: Lifespan of nuclear plants (in years)
\end{itemize}

Define the decision variables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $coal_t$: Amount of coal capacity added in year $t$
    \item $nuke_t$: Amount of nuclear capacity added in year $t$
\end{itemize}

The objective is to minimize the total cost:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{t=1}^T (coal\_cost \cdot coal_t + nuke\_cost \cdot nuke_t)
\]

Subject to the following constraints:

1. **Demand Satisfaction**:
   \[
   oil_t + \sum_{j=1}^{\min(t, coal\_life)} coal_{t-j+1} + \sum_{j=1}^{\min(t, nuke\_life)} nuke_{t-j+1} \geq demand_t \quad \forall t = 1, \ldots, T
   \]

2. **Nuclear Capacity Constraint**:
   \[
   \sum_{t=1}^{T} nuke_t \leq max\_nuke \cdot \left( \sum_{t=1}^{T} \left( oil_t + \sum_{j=1}^{\min(t, coal\_life)} coal_{t-j+1} + \sum_{j=1}^{\min(t, nuke\_life)} nuke_{t-j+1} \right) \right) \quad \forall t = 1, \ldots, T
   \]

3. **Non-negativity**:
   \[
   coal_t \geq 0, \quad nuke_t \geq 0 \quad \forall t = 1, \ldots, T
   \]

The output will provide the following:

- "coal\_cap\_added": List of coal capacities added each year.
- "nuke\_cap\_added": List of nuclear capacities added each year.
- "total\_cost": Total cost of the capacity expansion.
