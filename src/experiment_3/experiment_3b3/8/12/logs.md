PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Suppose that there are \var{N} available currencies, and assume that one unit of currency \var{i} can be exchanged for \var{rate_{i,j}} units of currency \var{j} (Naturally, we assume that \var{rate_{i,j}} > 0).
- There are also certain regulations that impose a limit \var{limit_i} on the total amount of currency \var{i} that can be exchanged (whether to other currencies or from other currencies) on any given day.
- Suppose that we start the day with \var{start_i} units of currency \var{i}
- Provide a linear programming formulation of this problem. Assume that for any sequence \var{i_1}, â€¦ ,\var{i_k} of currencies, we have \var{rate_{i_1,i_2}}, \var{rate_{i_2,i_3}}, ..., \var{rate_{i_{k-1}, i_{k}}, \var{rate_{i_k, i_1}} <= 1, which means that wealth cannot be multiplied by going through a cycle of currencies.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "start": [start_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "limit": [limit_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "rate": [[rate_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., N] for i in 1, ..., N],
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to maximize the number of units of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day, through a sequence of currency transactions.

OUTPUT INFO: 

- The output json file contains a list of transactions, where each transaction is a json object with the following fields:
    - from: the currency that we are exchanging from
    - to: the currency that we are exchanging to
    - amount: the amount of currency that we are exchanging
- The output json file also contains the final amount of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day.

OUTPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": i,
            "to": j,
            "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
    ],
    "final_amount_of_currency_N": final_amount_of_currency_N

\maketitle

\section*{Problem Formulation}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( N \): Number of available currencies.
    \item \( start_i \): Initial units of currency \( i \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, N \).
    \item \( limit_i \): Maximum limit of currency \( i \) that can be exchanged for any day for \( i = 1, \ldots, N \).
    \item \( rate_{i,j} \): Exchange rate from currency \( i \) to currency \( j \) for \( i, j = 1, \ldots, N \) (with \( rate_{i,j} > 0 \)).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Define the decision variables:
\[
x_{i,j} \geq 0 
\]
where \( x_{i,j} \) represents the amount of currency \( i \) that is exchanged for currency \( j \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to maximize the total amount of currency \( N \) at the end of the day:
\[
\text{Maximize } Z = x_{N} + \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{N,j}
\]

where \( x_{N} \) is the amount of currency \( N \) held at the end of the day, and \( x_{N,j} \) is the amount exchanged from currency \( N \) to currency \( j \).

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. **Exchange Limits**:
   For each currency \( i \):
   \[
   \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} \leq limit_i \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
   \]

2. **Starting Amounts**:
   At the end of the day, the amount of each currency \( i \) must be equal to the starting amount plus the transactions made:
   \[
   \text{Final amount of currency } i = start_i + \sum_{j \neq i} x_{i,j} - \sum_{k \neq i} x_{k,i} \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
   \]

3. **Non-negativity**:
   \[
   x_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \forall i, j
   \]

4. **Cycle Constraints**:
   Given that for any cycle of currencies \( i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k \):
   \[
   rate_{i_1,i_2}, rate_{i_2,i_3}, \ldots, rate_{i_k,i_1} \leq 1
   \]

\subsection*{Conclusion}
This linear programming formulation provides a structured approach to maximize the final amount of currency \( N \) by strategically managing the available currencies under given constraints.

#### Extract data
N = data['N']

Rate = data['Rate']

#### Define the linear programming problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Currency_Exchange_Maximization", pulp.LpMaximize)

#### Decision variables
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("x", ((i, j) for i in range(N) for j in range(N)), lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')

#### Objective function
problem += pulp.lpSum(x[N-1, j] for j in range(N)) 

#### Constraints

#### 1. Exchange limits
for i in range(N):
    problem += pulp.lpSum(x[i, j] for j in range(N)) <= Limit[i]

#### 2. Final amount constraints
for i in range(N):
    problem += Start[i] + pulp.lpSum(x[i, j] for j in range(N) if j != i) - pulp.lpSum(x[j, i] for j in range(N) if j != i) >= 0

#### 4. Cycle constraints
#### These are typically derived from the rates ensuring no arbitrage, but we assume proper rates given in input

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Output the objective value
