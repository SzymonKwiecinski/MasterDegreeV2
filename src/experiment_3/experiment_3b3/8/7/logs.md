PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The evolution of the rocket's state can be described by the following discrete-time equations:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]
\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

Where the acceleration \( a_t \) is controlled through thrust, and its magnitude \( |a_t| \) is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \( t \).

Given the initial conditions:

\[
x_0 = \text{initial position}
\]
\[
v_0 = \text{initial velocity}
\]

We want to reach a target position \( x_T \) with a target velocity \( v_T \) at time \( T \). The goal is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which can be expressed mathematically as:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad M = \max_{t=0}^{T} |a_t|
\]

######### Subject to the constraints:

1. Position and velocity constraints:
   \[
   x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t, \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]
   \[
   v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t, \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]

2. Boundary conditions:
   \[
   x_0 = x_0, \quad v_0 = v_0
   \]
   \[
   x_T = x_T, \quad v_T = v_T
   \]

3. Acceleration thrust bounds:
   \[
   -M \leq a_t \leq M, \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]

######### Output Information

The output should be structured as follows:
