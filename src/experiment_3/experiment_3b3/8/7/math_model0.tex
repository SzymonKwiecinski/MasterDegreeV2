\section*{Rocket Trajectory Optimization}

Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \), respectively. The evolution of the rocket's state can be described by the following discrete-time equations:

\[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
\]
\[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
\]

Where the acceleration \( a_t \) is controlled through thrust, and its magnitude \( |a_t| \) is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \( t \).

Given the initial conditions:

\[
x_0 = \text{initial position}
\]
\[
v_0 = \text{initial velocity}
\]

We want to reach a target position \( x_T \) with a target velocity \( v_T \) at time \( T \). The goal is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which can be expressed mathematically as:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad M = \max_{t=0}^{T} |a_t|
\]

### Subject to the constraints:

1. Position and velocity constraints:
   \[
   x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t, \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]
   \[
   v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t, \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]

2. Boundary conditions:
   \[
   x_0 = x_0, \quad v_0 = v_0
   \]
   \[
   x_T = x_T, \quad v_T = v_T
   \]

3. Acceleration thrust bounds:
   \[
   -M \leq a_t \leq M, \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]

### Output Information

The output should be structured as follows:

\[
\text{Output} = 
\begin{cases}
x = [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T] \\
v = [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T] \\
a = [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T] \\
\text{fuel\_spend} = \text{total fuel consumed}
\end{cases}
\]
