PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

\section*{Mathematical Model for Delivery Problem}

\subsection*{Variables}
Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N$: Number of streets
    \item $W$: Number of avenues
    \item $west\_time_{n,w}$: Time to move from intersection $(w, n)$ to $(w+1, n)$
    \item $north\_time_{n,w}$: Time to move from intersection $(w, n)$ to $(w, n+1)$
    \item $x_{n,w}$: Binary variable, where $x_{n,w} = 1$ if the delivery person moves north from $(w, n)$, and $0$ otherwise.
    \item $y_{n,w}$: Binary variable, where $y_{n,w} = 1$ if the delivery person moves west from $(w, n)$, and $0$ otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total time taken to traverse the grid:
\[
\text{minimize} \quad T = \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W} north\_time_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w} + \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} west\_time_{n,w} \cdot y_{n,w}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
Movement constraints:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each intersection can only have one movement decision at a time:
    \[
    x_{n,w} + y_{n,w} \leq 1, \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N-1\}, \forall w \in \{1, \ldots, W\}
    \]
    \item Boundary conditions for the beginning and end of the path:
    \[
    \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} y_{1,w} = 0 \quad \text{(start point)}
    \]
    \[
    \sum_{w=1}^{W} x_{N-1,w} = 1 \quad \text{(end point)}
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Output}
The output will consist of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item `paths`: The sequence of intersections traversed by the delivery person.
    \item `total_time`: The total time taken to travel the path.
\end{itemize}
