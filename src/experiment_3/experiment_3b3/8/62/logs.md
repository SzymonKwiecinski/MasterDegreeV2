PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A traveler based in \var{start_city} needs to visit \var{N} towns for business.
- The distance \var{distance_{i,j}} between city \var{i} and \var{j} is provided in miles and are symmetric, meaning the distance from city \var{i} to city \var{j} is the same as from city \var{j} to city \var{i}.
- The traveler must return to \var{start_city} after visiting all towns.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "distances": {
        city_i: {
            city_j: distance_{i, j},
            for j in 1, ..., N-1
        },
        for i in 1, ..., N
    },
    "start_city": start_city
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the shortest route that the traveler can take to visit all \var{N} towns and return to \var{start_city}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- The sequence of cities visited after \var{start_city} is \var{visit_order}.
- \var{total_distance} traveled on this optimal journey.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "visit_order": [city_n for n in 1, ..., N+1],
    "total_distance": total_distance
}

\section*{Mathematical Model for the Traveling Salesman Problem}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N$: Number of towns to visit.
    \item $distance_{i,j}$: Distance between town $i$ and town $j$ (symmetric).
    \item $start\_city$: The city where the traveler starts and returns.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{i,j}$: Binary variable that is 1 if the traveler goes from city $i$ to city $j$, and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total distance traveled:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} distance_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each town must be visited exactly once:
    \[
    \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{start\_city,j} = 1 \quad \forall j \in {1, \ldots, N}
    \]
    
    \item From each town, the traveler must leave to another town:
    \[
    \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} = 1 \quad \forall i \in {1, \ldots, N}
    \]

    \item Returning to the start city after visiting all towns:
    \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i,start\_city} = 1
    \]

    \item Subtour elimination constraints to prevent cycles (Miller-Tucker-Zemlin constraints):
    \[
    u_i - u_j + N \cdot x_{i,j} \leq N - 1 \quad \forall i,j \in {1, \ldots, N}, i \neq j
    \]
    where $u_i$ is a continuous variable representing the position of town $i$ in the tour.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Output}
The solution will provide:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $visit\_order$: Sequence of towns visited after $start\_city$.
    \item $total\_distance$: Total distance traveled in the optimal journey.
\end{itemize}
