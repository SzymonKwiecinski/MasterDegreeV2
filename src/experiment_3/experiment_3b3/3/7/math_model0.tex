\section*{Rocket Motion Optimization Problem}

We are given a rocket that travels along a straight path, and we define the following variables at time \( t \):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_t \): Position of the rocket
    \item \( v_t \): Velocity of the rocket
    \item \( a_t \): Acceleration of the rocket
\end{itemize}

The discrete-time dynamics of the rocket can be modeled as follows:
\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t
\end{align}

Where the acceleration \( a_t \) is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust. We assume that the magnitude \( |a_t| \) of the acceleration is proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \( t \).

Given the initial conditions:
\[
x_0, \quad v_0
\]
and the target conditions:
\[
x_T, \quad v_T \quad \text{at time} \quad T
\]

We formulate the objective of our optimization problem as minimizing the maximum thrust required, represented mathematically as:
\[
\text{Minimize } \max_{t} |a_t|
\]

The optimization will also be subject to the following constraints derived from the dynamics of the rocket:
\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
    x_0 &= \text{given initial position} \\
    v_0 &= \text{given initial velocity} \\
    x_T &= \text{target position} \\
    v_T &= \text{target velocity}
\end{align}

We will denote the total fuel spent as `fuel_spent`, which can be represented as:
\[
\text{fuel\_spent} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

The output will include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item key "x": A list of positions of the rocket at each time step from \( 0 \) to \( T \)
    \item key "v": A list of velocities of the rocket at each time step from \( 0 \) to \( T \)
    \item key "a": A list of accelerations of the rocket at each time step from \( 0 \) to \( T \)
    \item key "fuel\_spend": Total fuel spent by the rocket
\end{itemize}

The output format will be as follows:
\[
\{
    "x": [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T],
    "v": [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T],
    "a": [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, T],
    "fuel\_spend": \text{fuel\_spent}
\}
\]
