PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

\section*{Rocket Motion Optimization Problem}

Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \( t \). By discretizing time and taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain the following discrete-time model:

\[
\begin{align*}
x_{t+1} & = x_t + v_t \\
v_{t+1} & = v_t + a_t
\end{align*}
\]

We assume that the acceleration \( a_t \) is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust. The magnitude \( |a_t| \) of the acceleration can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \( t \).

Given the initial position \( x_0 \) and the initial velocity \( v_0 \) of the rocket, we wish for the rocket to take off and reach a target position \( x_T \) with speed \( v_T \) at time \( T \). Furthermore, we aim to accomplish this task in an economical fashion, using as little fuel as possible.

\subsection*{Input Format}
The input to the problem is given as follows:
\[
\{
    x_0, v_0, x_T, v_T, T
\}
\]

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to minimize the total fuel consumption, represented mathematically as:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
The problem must satisfy the constraints defined by the rocket's motion:

\[
\begin{align*}
x_{t+1} & = x_t + v_t, \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
v_{t+1} & = v_t + a_t, \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
x_0 & = x_0 \\
v_0 & = v_0 \\
x_T & = x_T \\
v_T & = v_T
\end{align*}
\]

\subsection*{Output Information}
The output of the problem will include:

\[
\{
    x: [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T], \\
    v: [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T], \\
    a: [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T], \\
    \text{fuel\_spend}: \text{total fuel spent}

- The objective function was incorrectly nested with multiple `pulp.lpSum()` calls. This has been corrected to a single `pulp.lpSum()` that correctly sums the absolute values of the acceleration `a[t]`. 
- The code retains its original business logic and structure without changing the intended functionality or using loops as specified.
