\section*{Rocket Motion Optimization Problem}

Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. Let \( x_t \), \( v_t \), and \( a_t \) be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \( t \). By discretizing time and taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain the following discrete-time model:

\[
\begin{align*}
x_{t+1} & = x_t + v_t \\
v_{t+1} & = v_t + a_t
\end{align*}
\]

We assume that the acceleration \( a_t \) is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust. The magnitude \( |a_t| \) of the acceleration can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \( t \).

Given the initial position \( x_0 \) and the initial velocity \( v_0 \) of the rocket, we wish for the rocket to take off and reach a target position \( x_T \) with speed \( v_T \) at time \( T \). Furthermore, we aim to accomplish this task in an economical fashion, using as little fuel as possible.

\subsection*{Input Format}
The input to the problem is given as follows:
\[
\{
    x_0, v_0, x_T, v_T, T
\}
\]

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to minimize the total fuel consumption, represented mathematically as:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
The problem must satisfy the constraints defined by the rocket's motion:

\[
\begin{align*}
x_{t+1} & = x_t + v_t, \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
v_{t+1} & = v_t + a_t, \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
x_0 & = x_0 \\
v_0 & = v_0 \\
x_T & = x_T \\
v_T & = v_T
\end{align*}
\]

\subsection*{Output Information}
The output of the problem will include:

\[
\{
    x: [x_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T], \\
    v: [v_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T], \\
    a: [a_i \text{ for } i = 0, \ldots, T], \\
    \text{fuel\_spend}: \text{total fuel spent}
\}
\]
