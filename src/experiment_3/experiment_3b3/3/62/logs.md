PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A traveler based in \var{start_city} needs to visit \var{N} towns for business.
- The distance \var{distance_{i,j}} between city \var{i} and \var{j} is provided in miles and are symmetric, meaning the distance from city \var{i} to city \var{j} is the same as from city \var{j} to city \var{i}.
- The traveler must return to \var{start_city} after visiting all towns.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "distances": {
        city_i: {
            city_j: distance_{i, j},
            for j in 1, ..., N-1
        },
        for i in 1, ..., N
    },
    "start_city": start_city
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the shortest route that the traveler can take to visit all \var{N} towns and return to \var{start_city}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- The sequence of cities visited after \var{start_city} is \var{visit_order}.
- \var{total_distance} traveled on this optimal journey.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "visit_order": [city_n for n in 1, ..., N+1],
    "total_distance": total_distance
}

\section*{Mathematical Model for the Traveling Salesman Problem}

\textbf{Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( x_{i,j} \) be a binary variable that is equal to 1 if the traveler travels directly from city \( i \) to city \( j \), and 0 otherwise.
    \item Let \( d_{i,j} \) be the distance between city \( i \) and city \( j \).
    \item Let \( N \) be the total number of towns to visit.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective Function:}
The objective is to minimize the total distance traveled:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} d_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j}
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}
1. Each town must be visited exactly once:
\[
\sum_{j=1, j \neq i}^{N} x_{i,j} = 1 \quad \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}
\]
 
2. Each town must be departed from exactly once:
\[
\sum_{i=1, i \neq j}^{N} x_{i,j} = 1 \quad \forall j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}
\]

3. Subtour elimination constraints (Miller-Tucker-Zemlin formulation):
\[
u_i - u_j + N \cdot x_{i,j} \leq N - 1 \quad \forall i \neq j, \quad i,j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}
\]
where \( u_i \) is an auxiliary variable representing the position of town \( i \) in the tour.

4. The traveler must start and end at the designated start city, e.g., \( \text{start\_city} \):
\[
x_{\text{start\_city},j} = 1 \quad \forall j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\} \quad \text{and} \quad x_{j,\text{start\_city}} = 1 \quad \forall j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}
\]

\textbf{Output:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The sequence of cities visited after \(\text{start\_city}\) is denoted as \( \text{visit\_order} \).
    \item The total distance traveled on the optimal journey is denoted as \( \text{total\_distance} = Z \).
