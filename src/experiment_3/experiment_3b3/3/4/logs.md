PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- A hospital wants to make a weekly night shift (12pm-8am) schedule for its nurses. 
- The demand for nurses for the night shift on day \var{j} = 1,...,7 is an integer \var{d_j}. 
- Every nurse works \var{period} days in a row on the night shift, followed by (7 - \var{period}) days off.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "period": period,
    "demand": [d_j for j in 1, ...,7]
}

OBJECTIVE: The goal is to find the minimal number of nurses the hospital needs to hire. 

OUTPUT INFO: 

- for each day \var{j} = 1,...,7, \var{start_j} which shows the number of nurses that start their period on day \var{j}.
- the total number of nurses hired.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "start": [start_j for j in 1, ...,7],
    "total": total
}

\section*{Mathematical Model for Nurse Scheduling Problem}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( \text{period} \) be the number of days a nurse works consecutively.
    \item Let \( d_j \) be the demand for nurses on day \( j \) for \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( x_j \) be the number of nurses that start their period on day \( j \) for \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total number of nurses hired:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{j=1}^{7} x_j
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
For each day \( j \), the total number of nurses available must meet the demand:

\[
\sum_{i=0}^{\text{period}-1} x_{j-i} \geq d_j \quad \forall j \in \{1, \ldots, 7\}
\]

where \( x_k = 0 \) for \( k < 1 \) or \( k > 7 \) (nurses cannot start outside the defined days).

\subsection*{Output}
The output will include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The number of nurses that start their period on each day \( j \): \( \text{start} = [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_7] \)
    \item The total number of nurses hired: \( \text{total} = Z \)
