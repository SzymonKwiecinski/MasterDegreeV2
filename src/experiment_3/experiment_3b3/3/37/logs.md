PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A small firm specializes in making some types of spare automobile parts. 
- Each part is has to go through several shops 
- The required worker-hours for part \var{k} in shop \var{s} is \var{time_{k, s}}.
- The profit of part \var{k} is \var{profit_{k}}.
- The capacity of shop \var{s} is \var{capacity_{s}} working hours.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"time": [[time_{k, s} for s in 1,...,S] for k in 1,...,K],
	"profit": [profit_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
	"capacity": [capacity_{s} for s in 1,...,S]
}


OBJECTIVE: Formulate the problem of determining the quantities of each spare part to be made during the month so as to maximize profit.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{quantity} represents the amount of each spare part to be made

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"quantity": [quantity_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

\subsection*{Definitions}
Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( K \) = number of spare parts
    \item \( S \) = number of shops
    \item \( time_{k, s} \) = required worker-hours for part \( k \) in shop \( s \)
    \item \( profit_{k} \) = profit from part \( k \)
    \item \( capacity_{s} \) = capacity of shop \( s \) in working hours
    \item \( quantity_{k} \) = quantity of spare part \( k \) to be produced
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to maximize the total profit:
\[
\text{Maximize} \quad Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} profit_{k} \cdot quantity_{k}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
The production of parts is subject to the following constraints based on the shop capacities:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} time_{k, s} \cdot quantity_{k} \leq capacity_{s}, \quad \forall s = 1, \ldots, S
\]

\subsection*{Non-negativity Constraints}
Furthermore, we have:
\[
quantity_{k} \geq 0, \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
\]

\subsection*{Summary}
We need to solve the following linear programming problem:
\begin{align*}
\text{Maximize} & \quad Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} profit_{k} \cdot quantity_{k} \\
\text{Subject to} & \quad \sum_{k=1}^{K} time_{k, s} \cdot quantity_{k} \leq capacity_{s}, \quad \forall s = 1, \ldots, S \\
& \quad quantity_{k} \geq 0, \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
\end{align*}
