PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- To operate a cafeteria, the manager must ensure on-call duty based on the statistics on the required staff. 
- In the future days, the number of desired employees on day \var{n} is denoted with \var{num_{n}}.
- Each employee works \var{n_working_days} days in a row and then has \var{n_resting_days} days off.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"num": [num_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"n_working_days": n_working_days,
	"n_resting_days": n_resting_days
}


OBJECTIVE: Calculate the minimum number of employees to hire

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_number} represents the total number of employees to employ
- \var{is_work} represents whether employee is working a rest on each day. Its length is determined by \var{total_number}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"total_number": total_number,
	"is_work": [[is_work_{n, i} for n in 1,...,N] for i in 1,...,total_number]

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem as a linear programming model, we can define the following decision variables, constraints, and objective function:

Let's denote:
- \(x_i\) as a binary variable which is 1 if employee \(i\) is working on day \(n\) and 0 otherwise.

Given:
- \(N\) is the total number of days.
- \(num_n\) is the required number of employees for each day \(n\).
- \(n_{\text{working\_days}}\) is the number of consecutive working days.
- \(n_{\text{resting\_days}}\) is the number of consecutive resting days.

Objective:
- Minimize the total number of employees hired.

Constraints:
- For each day \(n\), the sum of employees working must be at least \(num_n\).
- Each employee works \(n_{\text{working\_days}}\) days followed by \(n_{\text{resting\_days}}\) days off.

Let's define the problem in the form of a linear programming model in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}

\begin{document}

\textbf{Linear Programming Model:}

Objective:
\begin{align}
    \text{Minimize} \quad & \sum_{i=1}^{M} z_i
\end{align}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(z_i = 1\) if employee \(i\) is hired, and 0 otherwise.
    \item \(x_{i,n} = 1\) if employee \(i\) works on day \(n\), and 0 otherwise.
    \item \(M\) is the maximum potential number of employees, set initially as a large number.
\end{itemize}

Subject to:
\begin{align}
    & \sum_{i=1}^{M} x_{i,n} \geq \text{num}_n, \quad \forall n = 1, \ldots, N \\
    & x_{i,n} = 0, \quad \forall n = 1, \ldots, N, \quad \text{if employee } i \text{ is resting} \\
    & \text{Each employee works for } n_{\text{working\_days}} \text{ consecutive days} \\
    & \text{followed by } n_{\text{resting\_days}} \text{ consecutive rest days} \\
    & z_i \geq x_{i,n}, \quad \forall i, \forall n \quad \text{(ensure } z_i = 1 \text{ if any } x_{i,n} = 1 \text{)}
\end{align}

Where the cycling pattern is given by:
\[
\text{If } x_{i,n} = 1 \text{ from day } n \text{ to } n + n_{\text{working\_days}} - 1, 
\]
then
\[
x_{i,n+k} = 0 \text{ for } k = n_{\text{working\_days}}, \ldots, n_{\text{working\_days}} + n_{\text{resting\_days}} - 1
\]

\end{document}
```

In this model, the main goal is to ensure that the staffing requirements are met for each day while minimizing the number of employed staff members. The model uses binary variables to determine whether an employee is hired and whether they work on a specific day. The constraints enforce the alternating working and resting schedules.
