PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
        for id in 1, ..., m
    ],
    "total_cost": total_cost

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To formulate this transportation problem as a Linear Programming (LP) model in LaTeX, we need to define our decision variables, constraints, and objective function. The primary goal is to minimize the total transportation cost while fulfilling supply and demand constraints. Let's represent the problem accordingly:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Soybean Transportation}

\subsection*{Indices}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( k \): Index for terminal cities (sources)
    \item \( p \): Index for port cities (intermediate nodes)
    \item \( l \): Index for destination cities (destinations)
    \item \( (i, j) \): Index for routes from city \( i \) to city \( j \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( C_{i,j} \): Cost of transporting one metric ton of soybeans from city \( i \) to city \( j \)
    \item \( \text{supply}_k \): Supply of soybeans available at terminal city \( k \)
    \item \( \text{demand}_l \): Demand for soybeans at destination city \( l \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{amount}_{i,j} \): Amount of soybeans transported from city \( i \) to city \( j \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total transportation cost:
\[
\text{minimize} \quad \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \times \text{amount}_{i,j}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Supply Constraints:} 
    \[
    \sum_{\text{for all outgoing routes from } k} \text{amount}_{k,j} \leq \text{supply}_k, \quad \forall k
    \]
    
    \item \textbf{Demand Constraints:}
    \[
    \sum_{\text{for all incoming routes to } l} \text{amount}_{i,l} \geq \text{demand}_l, \quad \forall l
    \]
    
    \item \textbf{Flow Conservation at Ports:}
    \[
    \sum_{\text{incoming to } p} \text{amount}_{i,p} = \sum_{\text{outgoing from } p} \text{amount}_{p,j}, \quad \forall p
    \]

    \item \textbf{Non-negativity Constraints:}
    \[
    \text{amount}_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall (i,j) \in A
    \]
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

This LaTeX formulation reads as follows:
- The objective function aims to minimize the total transportation cost across all routes.
- The supply constraints ensure that the amount shipped from each terminal does not exceed its available supply.
- The demand constraints ensure that the amount received at each destination meets or exceeds the demand.
- The flow conservation constraints maintain balance at the port cities, ensuring the amount arriving equals the amount departing.
- Non-negativity constraints ensure that negative amounts are not shipped.
