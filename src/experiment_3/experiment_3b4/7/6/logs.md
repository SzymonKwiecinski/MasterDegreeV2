PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the total fuel \sum_{t=0}^{\var{T}-1} |\var{a_t}| spent subject to the preceding constraints.

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To formulate this problem as a Linear Programming (LP) problem, we need to describe the system of equations and constraints according to the given information and objective. We aim to minimize the total fuel consumption subject to the given dynamics and constraints.

The mathematical model in LaTeX format is as follows:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Rocket Optimization Problem}

\subsection*{Problem Formulation}

Given:
\begin{align*}
    & x_0 \quad \text{(initial position)} \\
    & v_0 \quad \text{(initial velocity)} \\
    & x_T \quad \text{(target position at time } T\text{)} \\
    & v_T \quad \text{(target velocity at time } T\text{)} \\
    & T \quad \text{(final time)}
\end{align*}

We are tasked with determining the sequence of accelerations \( a_t \) that minimizes the total fuel consumption:

\[
\min \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

Subject to the discrete-time dynamics:
\begin{align*}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
\end{align*}

And the boundary conditions:
\begin{align*}
    x_0 &= \text{given} \\
    v_0 &= \text{given} \\
    x_T &= \text{given} \\
    v_T &= \text{given}
\end{align*}

To incorporate the absolute value into the linear program, we represent each \( |a_t| \) using an auxiliary variable \( u_t \):

\begin{align*}
    a_t &\leq u_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
    -a_t &\leq u_t \quad \forall t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
\end{align*}

Thus, the objective function becomes:
\[
\min \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} u_t
\]

\subsection*{Solution Format}

The output will be represented as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{x}: List of positions at each time step from 0 to \( T \).
    \item \texttt{v}: List of velocities at each time step from 0 to \( T \).
    \item \texttt{a}: List of accelerations at each time step from 0 to \( T \).
    \item \texttt{fuel\_spend}: Total fuel spent.
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

This LaTeX document outlines the LP formulation for minimizing the rocket's fuel consumption while achieving the given constraints on position and velocity. The auxiliary variables \( u_t \) are used to transform the absolute values in the objective function into a linear form suitable for LP.
