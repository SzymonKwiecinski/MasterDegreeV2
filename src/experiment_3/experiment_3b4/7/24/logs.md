<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A mining company is going to continue operating in a certain area for the next years. 
- There are \var{n_mines} mines in this area, but it can operate at most \var{n_maxwork} in any one year. 
- Although a mine may not operate in a certain year, it is still necessary to keep it ‘open’, in the sense that royalties are payable, if it be operated in a future year. 
- Clearly, if a mine is not going to be worked again, it can be permanently closed down and no more royalties need be paid. 
- The yearly royalties payable on each mine kept ‘open’ is \var{royalty_{k}} for mine \var{k}.
- There is an upper limit to the amount of ore, which can be extracted from each mine in a year. 
- The upper limit for mine \var{k} is \var{limit_{k}}.
- The ore from the different mines is of varying quality.
- This quality is measured on a scale so that blending ores together results in a linear combination of the quality measurements, for example, if equal quantities of two ores were combined, the resultant ore would have a quality measurement half way between
that of the ingredient ores. 
- The quality of ore from mine \var{k} is \var{quality_{k}}.
- In each year, it is necessary to combine the total outputs from each mine to produce a blended ore of exactly some stipulated quality.
- In year \var{i}, the required quality is \var{requiredquality_{i}}.
- The final blended ore sells for \var{price} ton each year. 
- Revenue and expenditure for future years must be discounted at a rate of \var{discount} per annum.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "n_mines": n_mines,
    "n_maxwork": n_maxwork,
    "royalty": [royalty_{k} for k in 1,...,K],

OBJECTIVE: To maximize profit, which mines should be operated each year and how much should they produce?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{isoperated} represents whether each mine is operated in each year
- \var{amount} represents the amount of ore produced by each mine in each year

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "isoperated": [[isoperated_{k, i} for i in 1,...,I] for k in 1,...K]
    "amount": [[amount_{k, i} for i in 1,...,I] for k in 1,...K]

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we need to set up a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model. The model will decide which mines to operate each year and how much ore to extract from each mine to maximize the profit. The constraints include operating at most a certain number of mines each year, quality requirements, and extraction limits.

Below is the mathematical representation of the problem in LaTeX format:

\end{align*}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{align*}
& \text{royalty}_{k} \text{: Yearly royalty for mine } k \\
& \text{limit}_{k} \text{: Maximum ore extractable from mine } k \text{ in any year} \\

& \text{amount}_{k,i} \geq 0 \text{: Continuous variable indicating the amount of ore extracted from mine } k \text{ in year } i
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Maximize the discounted profit over the years:
\begin{align*}
\max \sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{1}{(1 + \text{discount})^i} \left[ \text{price} \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{amount}_{k,i} - \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{royalty}_{k} \cdot \text{isoperated}_{k,i} \right]
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{align*}
& \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{amount}_{k,i} \cdot \text{quality}_{k} = \text{requiredquality}_{i} \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{amount}_{k,i}, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, I \\
& \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{isoperated}_{k,i} \leq n\_maxwork, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, I \\
& \text{amount}_{k,i} \leq \text{limit}_{k} \cdot \text{isoperated}_{k,i}, \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K, \forall i = 1, \ldots, I \\
& \text{amount}_{k,i} \geq 0, \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K, \forall i = 1, \ldots, I \\
& \text{isoperated}_{k,i} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K, \forall i = 1, \ldots, I 
\end{align*}

\end{document}
```

This LaTeX code illustrates the MIP model for the mining problem. The objective is to maximize the discounted profit while adhering to constraints regarding mine operations, ore extraction limits, and blended quality requirements.
