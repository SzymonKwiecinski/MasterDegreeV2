PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- A manager of an oil refinery has \var{allocated_i} million barrels of crude oil type \var{i} allocated for production during the coming month. 
- These resources can be used to make \var{P} different products. product \var{p} sells for $ \var{price_p} per barrel.
- There are \var{L} production processes. Process \var{l} uses \var{input_l_i} barrels of each crude \var{i}, and produces \var{output_l_p} barrels of each product \var{p}. 
- Process \var{l} has a cost of \var{cost_l} per barrel of product produced.
- All \var{input_l_i} quantities and \var{output_l_p} quanitites are in barrels. 
- There are no separate cost items for the cost of the crudes, as they have already been allocated.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "allocated": [allocated_i for i in 1, ..., O],
    "price": [price_p for p in 1, ..., P],
    "input": [[input_l_i for i in 1, ..., O] for l in 1, ..., L],
    "output": [[output_l_p for p in 1, ..., P] for l in 1, ..., L],
    "cost": [cost_l for l in 1, ..., L]
}

OBJECTIVE: We want to know how many times should we execute each process to maximize the revenue for the next month (you can assume that the number of times that each process is executed is a floating point number)

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{revenue} is the total revenue for the month.
- \var{execute_l} is the number of times that process \var{l} should be executed.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "revenue": revenue,
    "execute": [execute_l for l in 1, ..., L]
}

To construct a linear programming model for the given oil refinery problem, we'll first identify the decision variables, objective function, and constraints:

######### Decision Variables:
Let \( x_l \) denote the number of times process \( l \) is executed, for \( l = 1, \ldots, L \).

######### Objective Function:
We aim to maximize the revenue from selling the products, taking into account the cost of the production processes. The revenue for selling product \( p \) from process \( l \) is \( \text{output}_{l,p} \times \text{price}_p \) per execution of process \( l \). The cost of executing process \( l \) is \( \text{cost}_l \times x_l \). The total objective function is:

\[
\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( \sum_{p=1}^{P} \text{output}_{l,p} \times \text{price}_p - \text{cost}_l \right) \times x_l
\]

######### Constraints:
1. **Resource Constraints:** The sum of the crude oil used in all processes should not exceed the allocated amount for each crude oil type \( i \).

   \[
   \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{input}_{l,i} \times x_l \leq \text{allocated}_i \quad \text{for } i = 1, \ldots, O
   \]

2. **Non-negativity Constraints:** Each \( x_l \) must be non-negative.

   \[
   x_l \geq 0 \quad \text{for } l = 1, \ldots, L
   \]

Below is the LaTeX representation of the LP model:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}

Let \( x_l \) be the number of times process \( l \) is executed, for \( l = 1, \ldots, L \).

\textbf{Objective Function:}

Maximize the total revenue minus the cost of production:
\[
\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( \sum_{p=1}^{P} \text{output}_{l,p} \times \text{price}_p - \text{cost}_l \right) \times x_l
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}

\begin{align*}
& \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{input}_{l,i} \times x_l \leq \text{allocated}_i, \quad \text{for } i = 1, \ldots, O \\
& x_l \geq 0, \quad \text{for } l = 1, \ldots, L
\end{align*}

\end{document}
```

This model can be used to determine the optimal execution frequency of each process to maximize the refinery's revenue given the constraints on crude oil allocation.
