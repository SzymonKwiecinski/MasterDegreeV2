PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- A hospital wants to make a weekly night shift (12pm-8am) schedule for its nurses. 
- The demand for nurses for the night shift on day \var{j} = 1,...,7 is an integer \var{d_j}. 
- Every nurse works \var{period} days in a row on the night shift, followed by (7 - \var{period}) days off.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "period": period,
    "demand": [d_j for j in 1, ...,7]
}

OBJECTIVE: The goal is to find the minimal number of nurses the hospital needs to hire. 

OUTPUT INFO: 

- for each day \var{j} = 1,...,7, \var{start_j} which shows the number of nurses that start their period on day \var{j}.
- the total number of nurses hired.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "start": [start_j for j in 1, ...,7],
    "total": total
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model the given problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, we need to define the decision variables, constraints, and the objective function.

######### Decision Variables:
- Let \( x_j \) be the number of nurses that start their working period on day \( j \).
- The total number of nurses hired will be denoted as \( \text{total} \).

######### Objective:
Minimize \(\text{total} = \sum_{j=1}^{7} x_j\)

######### Constraints:
1. For each day \( j \), the number of nurses working should meet the demand \( d_j \).
2. The cyclic nature of the schedule needs to be taken into account. To determine the number of nurses working on any given day \( j \), we need to consider the cyclic shifts:
   - \( \sum_{i=0}^{\text{period} - 1} x_{(j-i-1) \mod 7 + 1} \geq d_j \)

   This constraint ensures that on each day \( j \), there are enough nurses who started their schedule within the last \( \text{period} \) days.

######### Model formulation in LaTeX:

\section*{Model Formulation}

\subsection*{Given:}
- \(\text{period}\): The number of consecutive working days for each nurse.
- \(\{d_j\}_{j=1}^{7}\): Demand for nurses on each day \( j \).

\subsection*{Objective:}
Minimize the total number of nurses, given by:
\[
\text{total} = \sum_{j=1}^{7} x_j
\]

\subsection*{Constraints:}
For each day \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \):
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{\text{period} - 1} x_{(j-i-1) \mod 7 + 1} \geq d_j
\]

\( x_j \geq 0 \) and integer for all \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \).

\vspace{1cm}

\subsection*{Decision Variables:}
- \( x_j \): Number of nurses that start on day \( j \).

\end{document}
```

This model takes into account the cyclic nature of the schedule over a week, minimizing the number of nurses while meeting the daily demand. Each constraint ensures that the demand for nurses is met on each day given the working period and off days.
