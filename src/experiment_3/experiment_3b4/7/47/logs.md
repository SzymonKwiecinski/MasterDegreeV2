PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- The town has \var{S} different shifts for the police officers during the day.
- During each shift \var{s}, the town requires \var{officers_needed_{s}} police officers on duty.
- Each police officer works for two consecutive shifts.
- The cost for the town when starting a shift at \var{s} is \var{shift_cost_{s}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "officers_needed": [officers_needed_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "shift_costs": [shift_cost_{s} for s in 1, ..., S]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many officers should the town assign to each shift in order to minimize the total cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- The number of officers assigned to each shift \var{officers_assigned_{s}}.
- \var{total_cost} indicates the total cost for the town.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "officers_assigned": [officers_assigned_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we need to develop a linear programming model. The objective is to minimize the total cost of assigning officers to shifts while satisfying the requirement that each shift has a specified number of officers, considering each officer works for two consecutive shifts.

Let's define our decision variables:
- Let \( x_s \) represent the number of officers starting their shift at time \( s \).

The constraints and objective can be defined as follows:

1. **Objective Function**: Minimize the total cost of officers starting at each shift.

   \[
   \text{Minimize } \sum_{s=1}^{S} \text{shift\_cost}_{s} \cdot x_s
   \]

2. **Constraints**: Ensure that during each shift \( s \), the required number of officers is on duty. Since each officer works for two consecutive shifts, the number of officers on duty during shift \( s \) is the sum of officers starting at \( s \) and those who started at the previous shift \( (s-1) \).

   \[
   x_s + x_{s-1} \geq \text{officers\_needed}_{s} \quad \forall s = 1, \ldots, S
   \]

   We'll assume a circular shift pattern, hence:
   \[
   x_0 \equiv x_S
   \]

3. **Non-negativity Constraints**: 
   \[
   x_s \geq 0 \quad \forall s = 1, \ldots, S
   \]

Here's how this model looks in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Shift Assignment}

\subsection*{Objective}
Minimize the total cost of officers starting at each shift:
\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{s=1}^{S} \text{shift\_cost}_{s} \cdot x_s
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
Ensure that during each shift, the required number of officers is on duty:
\[
x_s + x_{s-1} \geq \text{officers\_needed}_{s}, \quad \forall s = 1, \ldots, S
\]

Assuming a circular shift pattern, we can also express:
\[
x_0 \equiv x_S
\]

\subsection*{Non-negativity Constraints}
\[
x_s \geq 0, \quad \forall s = 1, \ldots, S
\]

\end{document}
```

This model will help determine the optimal number of officers to assign to each shift \( x_s \), such that the total cost is minimized while meeting the officer requirements for each shift.
