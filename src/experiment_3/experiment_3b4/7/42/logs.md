PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- An Italian transport company must send empty containers from its depots to ports. 
- The number of containers available in the depot \var{i} is denoted with \var{numdepot_i}. 
- Container requirement in port \var{j} is \var{numport_{j}}. 
- Transport of containers is by barges. 
- Each barge can only contain two containers and the cost of transport (per barge) is proportional to the distance traveled (price is \var{price} Euros/km).
- The distances between depot \var{i} and port \var{j} is \var{distance_{i, j}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"numdepot": [numdepot_{i} for i in 1,...,I],
	"numport": [numport_{j} for j in 1,...,J],
	"price": price,
	"distance": [[distance_{i, j} for i in 1,...I] for j in 1,...,J]
}


OBJECTIVE: Minimize the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT INFO:

\var{number} represents the number of containers sent from each depot to port

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"number": [[number_{i, j} for i in 1,...,I] for j in 1,...,J]
}

To formulate this problem as a Linear Programming (LP) model, we need to define decision variables, the objective function, and the constraints.

######### Decision Variables:
Let \( x_{i,j} \) represent the number of containers transported from depot \( i \) to port \( j \).

######### Objective Function:
The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost. The cost of sending two containers from depot \( i \) to port \( j \) is given by \( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{distance}_{i,j} \times \text{price} \times x_{i,j} \) since each barge holds two containers.

The total cost for all transport operations is:
\[
\text{Minimize } \quad Z = \sum_{i=1}^{I} \sum_{j=1}^{J} \frac{1}{2} \times \text{distance}_{i,j} \times \text{price} \times x_{i,j}
\]

######### Constraints:
1. **Supply constraints for each depot**: The number of containers sent from each depot cannot exceed its available number of containers.
   \[
   \sum_{j=1}^{J} x_{i,j} \leq \text{numdepot}_i \quad \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, I\}
   \]

2. **Demand constraints for each port**: The number of containers received at each port must fulfill the port's requirement.
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{I} x_{i,j} = \text{numport}_j \quad \forall j \in \{1, \ldots, J\}
   \]

3. **Non-negativity constraints**: The number of containers transported must be non-negative.
   \[
   x_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, I\}, j \in \{1, \ldots, J\}
   \]

######### LP Formulation in LaTeX:
Here is the LaTeX code to represent this LP formulation:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\textbf{Objective:}

Minimize the total transportation cost:
\[
Z = \sum_{i=1}^{I} \sum_{j=1}^{J} \frac{1}{2} \times \text{distance}_{i,j} \times \text{price} \times x_{i,j}
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}

Supply constraints for each depot:
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{J} x_{i,j} \leq \text{numdepot}_i \quad \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, I\}
\]

Demand constraints for each port:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{I} x_{i,j} = \text{numport}_j \quad \forall j \in \{1, \ldots, J\}
\]

Non-negativity constraints:
\[
x_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, I\}, j \in \{1, \ldots, J\}
\]

\end{document}
```

This mathematical model can be solved using LP solvers to find the optimal number of containers to send from each depot to each port in order to minimize transportation costs.
