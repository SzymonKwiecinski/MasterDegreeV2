PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

To solve this problem, we can formulate it as a linear programming problem where the objective is to minimize the total travel time subject to constraints that ensure the delivery person can only move north or west on the grid.

Let's define the decision variables and constraints to model this problem:

**Decision Variables:**
- \( x_{n,w}^N \): Binary variable that is 1 if the delivery person moves north from intersection \( (n, w) \) to \( (n+1, w) \) and 0 otherwise.
- \( x_{n,w}^W \): Binary variable that is 1 if the delivery person moves west from intersection \( (n, w) \) to \( (n, w+1) \) and 0 otherwise.

**Objective Function:**
The objective is to minimize the total travel time, which can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W} x_{n,w}^N \cdot \text{north\_time}_{n,w} + \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} x_{n,w}^W \cdot \text{west\_time}_{n,w}
\]

**Constraints:**

1. **Flow Constraints:**
   - The delivery person starts at \( (1, 1) \).
   - The delivery person ends at \( (N, W) \).
   - The flow conservation at each intersection ensures that if the delivery person enters an intersection, they must leave it either north or west.

   For each \( (n, w) \):
   - If \( n < N \), then:
     \[
     \sum x_{n-1,w}^N + \sum x_{n,w-1}^W = \sum x_{n,w}^N + \sum x_{n,w}^W \quad (n > 1, w > 1)
     \]
   - Special cases for the start and end point:
     \[
     x_{1,1}^N + x_{1,1}^W = 1
     \]
     \[
     x_{N,W}^N + x_{N,W}^W = 0
     \]

2. **Binary Constraints:**
   \[
   x_{n,w}^N, x_{n,w}^W \in \{0, 1\}
   \]

Below is the linear programming formulation in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\begin{align*}
    \text{Minimize } & \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W} x_{n,w}^N \cdot \text{north\_time}_{n,w} + \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} x_{n,w}^W \cdot \text{west\_time}_{n,w} \\
    \text{Subject to: } & \\
    & x_{1,1}^N + x_{1,1}^W = 1 \\
    & \sum x_{n-1,w}^N + \sum x_{n,w-1}^W = \sum x_{n,w}^N + \sum x_{n,w}^W, \quad (n > 1, w > 1, n < N, w < W) \\
    & x_{N,W}^N = 0 \\
    & x_{N,W}^W = 0 \\
    & x_{n,w}^N, x_{n,w}^W \in \{0, 1\}
\end{align*}

\end{document}
```

This model finds the path that minimizes the total travel time while respecting the constraints of only moving north or west and ensuring all intersections are visited appropriately.
