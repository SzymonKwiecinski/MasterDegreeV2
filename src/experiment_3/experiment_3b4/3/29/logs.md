PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A quantity y is known to depend on another quantity x. A set of corresponding values has been collected for x and y and is presented.
- The \var{k}-th y value takes \var{y_{k}} and the \var{k}-th x value takes \var{x_{k}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "y": [y_{k} for k = 1,...,K],
    "x": [x_{k} for k = 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Fit the ‘best’ straight line y = bx + a where the objective is to minimize the maximum deviation of all the observed values of y from the value predicted by the linear relationship.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{intercept} represents the intercept of the fitted line
- \var{slope} represents the slope of the fitted line

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve the given problem, we need to fit the best straight line \( y = bx + a \) to the provided data points by minimizing the maximum deviation from the observed values. This can be expressed as a linear programming problem in the following way:

Let's denote the data points by \( (x_k, y_k) \) for \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, K \).

The objective is to minimize the maximum deviation, denoted by \( \delta \), from the observed \( y \) values. We need to consider the absolute deviation between the observed and predicted values at each point, which can be split into two linear constraints for each point.

The linear programming formulation is as follows:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Objective:}

\[
\min \delta
\]

\textbf{Subject to constraints:}

For each data point \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, K \):

\[
y_k - (bx_k + a) \leq \delta
\]

\[
(bx_k + a) - y_k \leq \delta
\]

These constraints represent that the absolute deviation between the observed value \( y_k \) and the predicted value \( bx_k + a \) is less than or equal to \( \delta \).

This is a linear programming problem with the decision variables:
- \( a \): Intercept of the fitted line.
- \( b \): Slope of the fitted line.
- \( \delta \): Maximum deviation.

\textbf{Solution:}

By solving this linear programming problem, we will obtain the values for \( a \) (intercept) and \( b \) (slope), which will be used to define the best-fit line. The objective value will give the minimized maximum deviation.

\end{document}
```

This linear programming problem can be solved using any LP solver by setting up the constraints and objective function as described. The output will provide the values of the slope \( b \) and intercept \( a \).
