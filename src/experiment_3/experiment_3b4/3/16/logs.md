PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- A manager of an oil refinery has \var{allocated_i} million barrels of crude oil type \var{i} allocated for production during the coming month. 
- These resources can be used to make \var{P} different products. product \var{p} sells for $ \var{price_p} per barrel.
- There are \var{L} production processes. Process \var{l} uses \var{input_l_i} barrels of each crude \var{i}, and produces \var{output_l_p} barrels of each product \var{p}. 
- Process \var{l} has a cost of \var{cost_l} per barrel of product produced.
- All \var{input_l_i} quantities and \var{output_l_p} quanitites are in barrels. 
- There are no separate cost items for the cost of the crudes, as they have already been allocated.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "allocated": [allocated_i for i in 1, ..., O],
    "price": [price_p for p in 1, ..., P],
    "input": [[input_l_i for i in 1, ..., O] for l in 1, ..., L],
    "output": [[output_l_p for p in 1, ..., P] for l in 1, ..., L],
    "cost": [cost_l for l in 1, ..., L]
}

OBJECTIVE: We want to know how many times should we execute each process to maximize the revenue for the next month (you can assume that the number of times that each process is executed is a floating point number)

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{revenue} is the total revenue for the month.
- \var{execute_l} is the number of times that process \var{l} should be executed.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "revenue": revenue,
    "execute": [execute_l for l in 1, ..., L]
}

To model this linear programming problem, we need to set up the objective function and constraints. The objective is to maximize the total revenue generated from selling the products produced through different processes, minus the cost associated with running those processes.

1. **Decision Variables:**
   - Let \( x_l \) be the number of times process \( l \) is executed, for \( l = 1, 2, ..., L \).

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The revenue generated from each product \( p \) when using process \( l \) is \( \text{price}_p \times \text{output}_{l,p} \).
   - The total cost when process \( l \) is executed is \( \text{cost}_l \times \sum_{p=1}^P \text{output}_{l,p} \times x_l \).

   Thus, the objective function to maximize is:
   \[
   \text{Maximize} \quad \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( \sum_{p=1}^{P} \text{price}_p \times \text{output}_{l,p} - \text{cost}_l \right) \times x_l
   \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - For each crude oil \( i \), total usage across all processes cannot exceed the allocation:
   \[
   \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{input}_{l,i} \times x_l \leq \text{allocated}_i, \quad \text{for each } i = 1, 2, ..., O
   \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
   \[
   x_l \geq 0, \quad \text{for each } l = 1, 2, ..., L
   \]

Let's encapsulate the above in a LaTeX document to formalize this LP transformation:

\section*{Mathematical Model}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Maximize the revenue:
\begin{equation}
\text{Maximize} \quad \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( \sum_{p=1}^{P} \text{price}_p \times \text{output}_{l,p} - \text{cost}_l \right) \times x_l
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{align}
\sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{input}_{l,i} \times x_l & \leq \text{allocated}_i, \quad \text{for each } i = 1, 2, ..., O \\
x_l & \geq 0, \quad \text{for each } l = 1, 2, ..., L
\end{align}

\end{document}
```

This model specifies how many times each process \( l \) should be executed to maximize the overall revenue, subject to the constraints on crude oil availability.
