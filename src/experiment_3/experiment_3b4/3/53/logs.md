PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},

    ],
    "demand": [

            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }

    ],

To model the given transportation problem as a linear programming problem, we need to minimize the transportation costs while meeting supply and demand constraints. Below is the formulation:

\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Minimizing Transportation Costs}

\subsection*{Sets and Indices}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( A \) be the set of all routes.
    \item Let \((i,j) \in A\) denote a route from city \(i\) to city \(j\).
    \item Let \(k\) index the terminal cities (sources).
    \item Let \(l\) index the destination cities.
    \item Let \(p\) index the port cities (intermediate nodes).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( C_{i,j} \): Cost per metric ton to transport soybeans from city \(i\) to city \(j\).
    \item \( \text{supply}_k \): Supply of soybeans available at terminal city \(k\).
    \item \( \text{demand}_l \): Demand for soybeans at destination city \(l\).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{amount}_{i,j} \): Amount of soybeans shipped from city \(i\) to city \(j\).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total transportation cost:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \times \text{amount}_{i,j}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Supply constraints for each terminal city \(k\):
    \[
    \sum_{j: (k,j) \in A} \text{amount}_{k,j} \leq \text{supply}_k, \quad \forall k
    \]
    
    \item Demand constraints for each destination city \(l\):
    \[
    \sum_{i: (i,l) \in A} \text{amount}_{i,l} \geq \text{demand}_l, \quad \forall l
    \]
    
    \item Flow conservation for each port city \(p\):
    \[
    \sum_{i: (i,p) \in A} \text{amount}_{i,p} = \sum_{j: (p,j) \in A} \text{amount}_{p,j}, \quad \forall p
    \]

    \item Non-negativity constraints:
    \[
    \text{amount}_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall (i,j) \in A
    \]
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

In this model:
- We are trying to distribute the available supply in a way that minimizes the total transportation cost.
- We ensure that the outgoing shipments from the terminal do not exceed its supply, meet the demands at the destinations, and maintain the balance at the ports.
- The flow conservation ensures that what enters a port city also leaves it to continue towards the final destination.

Each of the constraints ensures that the solution is feasible from a logistical and operational standpoint, while the objective function focuses on cost efficiency.
