PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A traveler based in \var{start_city} needs to visit \var{N} towns for business.
- The distance \var{distance_{i,j}} between city \var{i} and \var{j} is provided in miles and are symmetric, meaning the distance from city \var{i} to city \var{j} is the same as from city \var{j} to city \var{i}.
- The traveler must return to \var{start_city} after visiting all towns.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "distances": {
        city_i: {
            city_j: distance_{i, j},
            for j in 1, ..., N-1
        },
        for i in 1, ..., N
    },
    "start_city": start_city
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the shortest route that the traveler can take to visit all \var{N} towns and return to \var{start_city}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- The sequence of cities visited after \var{start_city} is \var{visit_order}.
- \var{total_distance} traveled on this optimal journey.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "visit_order": [city_n for n in 1, ..., N+1],
    "total_distance": total_distance
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
The given problem is a classic example of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is a well-known MILP problem. To determine the shortest route, we need to create a mathematical model that minimizes the total distance traveled while visiting each city exactly once and returning to the starting city.

The model includes:

- Decision Variables:
  - \( x_{i,j} \): A binary variable that is 1 if the path between city \( i \) and city \( j \) is included in the optimal tour, 0 otherwise.

- Objective Function:
  - Minimize the sum of the selected paths' distances.

- Constraints:
  - Ensure each city is entered exactly once,
  - Ensure each city is left exactly once,
  - Eliminate sub-tours to ensure a single cycle that visits all cities and returns to the start.

Here's the LATEX code for the MILP formulation:

\section*{MILP Formulation for Traveling Salesman Problem}

\textbf{Sets:}  
Let \( I = \{1, \ldots, N\} \) represent the set of cities, where 1 corresponds to \textit{start\_city}.

\textbf{Parameters:}  
\( d_{i,j} \): Distance between city \( i \) and city \( j \).

\textbf{Decision Variables:}  
\[
x_{i,j} =
\begin{cases} 
1, & \text{if the path from city } i \text{ to city } j \text{ is part of the tour} \\ 
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\textbf{Objective Function:}  
Minimize the total distance traveled:
\[
\min \sum_{i \in I} \sum_{j \in I, j \neq i} d_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j}
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}
\begin{align}
& \sum_{j \in I, j \neq i} x_{i,j} = 1, \quad \forall i \in I \quad \text{(each city is left once)} \\
& \sum_{i \in I, i \neq j} x_{i,j} = 1, \quad \forall j \in I \quad \text{(each city is entered once)} \\
& \sum_{i \in S} \sum_{j \in S, j \neq i} x_{i,j} \leq |S| - 1, \quad \forall S \subset I, 2 \leq |S| \leq N \quad \text{(sub-tour elimination)}
\end{align}

This set of constraints and the objective function forms a complete MILP model for solving the TSP with symmetric distances. The solution will provide the optimal sequence of cities \texttt{visit\_order} and the \texttt{total\_distance}.

\end{document}
```

This model can be implemented in a solver like Gurobi or CPLEX to obtain the optimal tour. The sub-tour elimination constraints prevent the formation of smaller cycles within the graph, ensuring that the solution is a single tour that visits each city once and returns to the starting city.
