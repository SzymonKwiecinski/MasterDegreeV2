PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"benefit": [[benefit_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...,K],
	"communication": [[communication_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
	"cost": [[cost_{l, m} for m in 1,...,L] for l in 1,...,L],
}


OBJECTIVE: Where should each department be located so as to minimize overall yearly cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{islocated_{k, l}} represents whether department \var{k} is relocated at city \var{l}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "islocated": [[islocated_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...K],
}

To model this problem as a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem, we need to consider the constraints and objective function based on the provided information. We will introduce binary variables to determine the location of departments and then formulate the objective function. 

Here's the mathematical model described in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Objective:} Minimize the overall yearly cost associated with relocating the departments.

\textbf{Sets:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $K$: Set of departments, indexed by $k$.
    \item $L$: Set of cities, including London, indexed by $l$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $benefit_{k, l}$: Benefit (in thousands of pounds) derived when department $k$ is relocated to city $l$.
    \item $communication_{k, j}$: Quantity of communication between department $k$ and department $j$.
    \item $cost_{l, m}$: Unit cost of communication between city $l$ and city $m$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $islocated_{k, l} \in \{0, 1\}$: Binary variable, equal to 1 if department $k$ is relocated to city $l$, 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective Function:}
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( -benefit_{k, l} \times islocated_{k, l} \right) + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{j=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{m=1}^{L} \left( communication_{k, j} \times cost_{l, m} \times islocated_{k, l} \times islocated_{j, m} \right)
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each department must be located in exactly one city:
    \[
    \sum_{l=1}^{L} islocated_{k, l} = 1, \quad \forall k \in K
    \]
    
    \item No city can have more than three departments:
    \[
    \sum_{k=1}^{K} islocated_{k, l} \leq 3, \quad \forall l \in L
    \]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Binary Constraints:}
\[
islocated_{k, l} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall k \in K, l \in L
\]

\end{document}
```

This formulation involves minimizing the negative of benefits summed with the communication costs for all departments in all cities, subject to constraints ensuring that each department is located in exactly one city and no city hosts more than three departments.
