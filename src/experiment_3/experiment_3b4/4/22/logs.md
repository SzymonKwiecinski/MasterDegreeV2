PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements in future years. 
- Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. 
- In addition to this, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, which will reduce the need for workers in all categories.
- The estimated manpower requirements for manpower \var{k} in year \var{i} is \var{requirement_{k, i}}.
- The current number of manpower \var{k} is \var{strength_{k}}.
- The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to recruitment, retraining, redundancy and short-time working in the next years.
- There is a natural wastage of labour. 
- A fairly large number of workers leave during their first year. After this, the rate of leaving is much smaller. 
- Taking this into account, the wastage rates of manpower \var{k} with less than one year's service is \var{lessonewaste_{k}}.
- The wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with more than one year's service is \var{moreonewaste_{k}}.
- There has been no recent recruitment and all the workers in the current labour force have been employed for more than one year.
- It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. 
- In any one year, the maximum number that can be recruited in manpower \var{k} is \var{recruit_{k}}.
- The redundancy payment to manpower \var{k} is \var{costredundancy_{k}}.
- It is possible to employ up to \var{num_overman} more workers over the whole company than are needed, but the extra costs per employee per year is \var{costoverman_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- Up to \var{num_shortwork} workers in each category of skill can be put on short-time working. 
- The cost of this (per employee per year) is \var{costshort_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of half a full-time employee.

To address the problem, we need to formulate a linear programming model to minimize redundancy costs. We will define the decision variables, constraints, and objective function in the context of the given data.

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Manpower Planning}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let:
\begin{align*}
R_{k,i} & : \text{number of recruits of manpower type } k \text{ in year } i, \\
O_{k,i} & : \text{number of overmanning manpower of type } k \text{ in year } i, \\
S_{k,i} & : \text{number of short-time manpower of type } k \text{ in year } i, \\
Red_{k,i} & : \text{number of redundancies of manpower type } k \text{ in year } i.
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize total redundancy costs:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{i=1}^{I} \text{costredundancy}_{k} \times Red_{k,i}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Manpower Balance Constraint:}
    \[
    \text{strength}_{k} \times (1 - \text{moreonewaste}_{k}) - \text{requirement}_{k,i} + R_{k,i} - Red_{k,i} + O_{k,i} + 0.5 \times S_{k,i} \geq 0 \quad \forall k, i
    \]
    This constraint ensures the available manpower meets the requirement considering wastage, recruitment, redundancy, overmanning, and short-time working.

    \item \textbf{Recruitment Limit Constraint:}
    \[
    0 \leq R_{k,i} \leq \text{recruit}_{k} \quad \forall k, i
    \]

    \item \textbf{Overmanning Limit Constraint:}
    \[
    \sum_{k=1}^{K} O_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_overman} \quad \forall i
    \]

    \item \textbf{Short-time Limit Constraint:}
    \[
    0 \leq S_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_shortwork} \quad \forall k, i
    \]

    \item \textbf{Non-negativity Constraint:}
    \[
    R_{k,i}, O_{k,i}, S_{k,i}, Red_{k,i} \geq 0 \quad \forall k, i
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Notes}
- After initial recruitment, the ``strength'' for the subsequent years needs to be updated according to recruitment and wastage.
- The full system of constraints must be solved simultaneously to get the optimal workforce plan that minimizes redundancy costs.

This model helps the company to make informed policy decisions regarding recruitment, overmanning, and short-time working while minimizing redundancy costs. The constraints ensure the correct workforce levels are maintained each year.
