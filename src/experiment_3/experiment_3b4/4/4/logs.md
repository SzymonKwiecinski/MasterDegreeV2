PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- A hospital wants to make a weekly night shift (12pm-8am) schedule for its nurses. 
- The demand for nurses for the night shift on day \var{j} = 1,...,7 is an integer \var{d_j}. 
- Every nurse works \var{period} days in a row on the night shift, followed by (7 - \var{period}) days off.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "period": period,
    "demand": [d_j for j in 1, ...,7]
}

OBJECTIVE: The goal is to find the minimal number of nurses the hospital needs to hire. 

OUTPUT INFO: 

- for each day \var{j} = 1,...,7, \var{start_j} which shows the number of nurses that start their period on day \var{j}.
- the total number of nurses hired.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "start": [start_j for j in 1, ...,7],
    "total": total
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem, we can use a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach. We will define binary decision variables to track the number of nurses starting their work period on each day of the week. Our goal is to minimize the total number of nurses while satisfying the daily demand constraint.

Let's define the variables and constraints:

######### Variables:
- \( \text{start}_j \): Number of nurses starting their shift on day \( j \) (integer variable) for \( j = 1, \dots, 7 \).

######### Constraints:
- Ensure that the demand for each day is met:
  - For each day \( j = 1, \dots, 7 \), the total number of nurses working that day must be at least equal to the demand \( d_j \). This can be expressed in terms of the start variables by considering the nurses who started working in the previous \( \text{period} \) days.

######### Objective:
- Minimize the total number of nurses hired, which is the sum of nurses starting over the week.

Now, let's translate this into a mathematical model in LaTeX format.

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Model}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{period} \): Number of consecutive days a nurse works.
    \item \( d_j \): Demand for nurses on day \( j \), \( j = 1, \dots, 7 \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{start}_j \): Number of nurses starting their shift on day \( j \), \( j = 1, \dots, 7 \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective}
Minimize the total number of nurses hired:
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{j=1}^{7} \text{start}_j
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
For each day \( j \), ensure the demand is met:
\[
\begin{aligned}
    n_j \geq d_j \quad & \forall j = 1, \dots, 7
\end{aligned}
\]

Where \( n_j \) is calculated as:
\[
n_j = \sum_{i=0}^{\text{period}-1} \text{start}_{((j-i-1) \mod 7) + 1}
\]

This expression accounts for the cyclic nature of the week, ensuring that for day \( j \), we consider nurses starting from the previous \text{period} days.

\subsection*{Integer Constraint}
\[
\text{start}_j \in \mathbb{Z}^+, \quad \forall j = 1, \dots, 7
\]

\end{document}
```

This MILP model seeks to minimize the number of nurses by determining the optimal starting day for each nurse while satisfying the weekly demand constraints.
