PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

To model this problem as a linear programming problem in LaTeX, we need to define our decision variables, the objective function, and the constraints. Here's how the LP formulation can be presented:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Rocket Trajectory Optimization}

\subsection*{Problem Formulation}

We are given the following discrete-time dynamics of a rocket:

\begin{align*}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t,
\end{align*}

where:
- \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \)
- \( x_0 \) and \( v_0 \) are the initial position and velocity,
- \( x_T \) and \( v_T \) are the target position and velocity at time \( T \),
- \( a_t \) is the control input (acceleration).

\subsection*{Objective}

Minimize the maximum thrust, which is proportional to fuel consumption:

\[
\min \max_{t} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. Dynamics constraints:
    \[
    x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
    \]
    \[
    v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
    \]

2. Initial conditions:
    \[
    x_0 = \text{given } x_0, \quad v_0 = \text{given } v_0
    \]

3. Target conditions:
    \[
    x_T = \text{given } x_T, \quad v_T = \text{given } v_T
    \]

4. Linearize the absolute value for the optimization:
    \[
    a_t \leq u, \quad -a_t \leq u \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
    \]

where \( u \) is an auxiliary variable representing the maximum magnitude of \( a_t \).

\subsection*{Variables}

- Decision variables: \( a_t \) for \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \)
- Auxiliary variable: \( u \)

\subsection*{Objective Function in LP Form}

\[
\min u
\]

\subsection*{Solution Output}

The output of the optimization will include:
- Positions: \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_T \)
- Velocities: \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_T \)
- Accelerations: \( a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{T-1} \)
- Total fuel spent, approximated by: 
  \[
  \text{fuel\_spend} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
  \]

\end{document}
```

This formulation sets up a linear programming problem where the goal is to minimize the maximum acceleration \( |a_t| \), under the dynamics constraints, initial conditions, and final target conditions. The absolute value in the objective is handled by introducing auxiliary variables and constraints.
