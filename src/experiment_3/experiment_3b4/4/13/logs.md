PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- Consider a set \var{P} described by linear inequality constraints, that is:
 \var{P} = {\var{x} \in R^\var{N} | \var{a_i}^T x <= \var{b_i} , i = 1, ..., m}.

where \var{a_i} \in R^\var{N} and \var{b_i} \in R

- A ball with center \var{y} in R^\var{N} and radius \var{r} is defined as the set of all points within (Euclidean) distance \var{r} from \var{y}.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "A": [[a_i_j for j in 1, ..., n] for i in 1, ..., m],
    "b": [b_i for i in 1, ..., m]
}

OBJECTIVE: We are interested in finding a ball with the largest possible radius, which is entirely contained within the set \var{P} (The center of such a ball is called the Chebychev center of \var{P}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- center (list): The center of the ball as a list of floats of length \var{N}
- radius (float): The radius of the ball as a float

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "center": [y_j for j in 1, ..., n],
    "radius": r
}

To solve this problem, we need to find the Chebychev center of the polyhedron \( P \), which is the center \( y \) of the largest ball that can fit inside \( P \). This requires formulating a linear programming problem.

Given the linear constraints of the set \( P \) as:

\[
P = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^N \mid a_i^T x \leq b_i, \, i = 1, \ldots, m \}
\]

We want to find the largest radius \( r \) of a ball centered at \( y \) that fits inside \( P \). The condition that a ball of radius \( r \) centered at \( y \) is contained in \( P \) can be expressed as:

\[
a_i^T y + \|a_i\| r \leq b_i \quad \text{for all } i = 1, \ldots, m
\]

This gives us a new set of constraints. Our objective is to maximize \( r \). This can be formulated as the following linear programming problem:

**Linear Programming Model:**

- **Variables**: \( y \in \mathbb{R}^N \), \( r \in \mathbb{R} \)
- **Objective**: Maximize \( r \)
- **Constraints**:
  \[
  a_i^T y + \|a_i\| r \leq b_i \quad \text{for all } i = 1, \ldots, m
  \]

Now, here's the LaTeX code for this linear programming formulation:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Linear Programming Formulation:}

We are given a set \( P \) defined by linear inequality constraints as follows:

\[
P = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^N \mid a_i^T x \leq b_i, \, i = 1, \ldots, m \}
\]

We aim to find a ball with the maximum possible radius \( r \) centered at \( y \), entirely contained within \( P \).

\[
\text{Maximize } r
\]

Subject to:

\[
a_i^T y + \|a_i\| r \leq b_i \quad \text{for } i = 1, \ldots, m
\]

Where:
- \( y \) is the center of the ball.
- \( r \) is the radius of the ball.
- \( a_i \in \mathbb{R}^N \),
- \( b_i \in \mathbb{R} \),
- \(\|a_i\|\) is the Euclidean norm of \( a_i \).

\end{document}
```

This model can be solved using linear programming techniques to determine the Chebychev center \( y \) and the maximum radius \( r \) of the ball that can fit inside the set \( P \).
