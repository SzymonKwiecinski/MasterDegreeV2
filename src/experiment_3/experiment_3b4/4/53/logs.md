PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
        for id in 1, ..., m
    ],
    "total_cost": total_cost

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this transportation problem as a Linear Programming (LP) problem, we need to minimize the total transportation cost while satisfying supply and demand constraints. The decision variables will represent the amount of soybeans shipped from one location to another. 

Let's define the decision variable \( x_{i,j} \) as the quantity of soybeans shipped from city \( i \) to city \( j \). The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost, which can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j}
\]

Subject to the following constraints:

1. Supply constraints at each source terminal \( i \):

\[
\sum_{j \mid (i,j) \in A} x_{i,j} \leq \text{supply}_i, \quad \forall \, i \text{ terminal}
\]

2. Demand constraints at each destination \( j \):

\[
\sum_{i \mid (i,j) \in A} x_{i,j} \geq \text{demand}_j, \quad \forall \, j \text{ destination}
\]

3. Non-negativity constraints:

\[
x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall \, (i,j) \in A
\]

Now, I'll convert this model into a LaTeX document:

\section*{Problem Formulation}

We are given a transportation network consisting of $n$ cities, where soybeans are shipped from terminal city $k$ to port city $p$, and from port city $p$ to destination city $l$. The task is to determine the optimal shipment of soybeans that minimizes transportation costs.

\subsection*{Objective Function}

Minimize the total transportation cost:

\[
Z = \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Supply Constraints:}
    \begin{align}
    \sum_{j \mid (i,j) \in A} x_{i,j} &\leq \text{supply}_{i}, \quad \forall \, i \text{ terminal}
    \end{align}

    \item \textbf{Demand Constraints:}
    \begin{align}
    \sum_{i \mid (i,j) \in A} x_{i,j} &\geq \text{demand}_{j}, \quad \forall \, j \text{ destination}
    \end{align}

    \item \textbf{Non-negativity Constraints:}
    \begin{align}
    x_{i,j} &\geq 0, \quad \forall \, (i,j) \in A
    \end{align}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Decision Variables}

Let $x_{i,j}$ denote the quantity of soybeans shipped from city $i$ to city $j$.

\section*{Input and Output}

The input consists of transportation routes with costs, supply at each terminal city, and demand at each destination city. The output is the optimal shipment plan and the associated total transportation cost.
