PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- We assume that there are available at the market different foods and that the food \var{k} sells at a price \var{price_{k}} per unit. 
- In addition there are several basic nutritional ingredients and, to achieve a balanced diet, each individual must receive at least \var{demand_{m}} units of nutrient \var{m} per day. 
- Finally, we assume that each unit of food \var{k} contains \var{nutri_{k, m}} units of nutrition \var{m}

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"price": [price_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
	"demand": [demand_{m} for m in 1,...,M],
	"nutrition": [[nutri_{k, m} for m in 1,...,M] for k in 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: We want to minimize the total prices of the foods to purchase.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{quantity} represents the quantity of each food to purchase

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"quantity": [quantity_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}

To solve this Linear Programming problem, we need to formulate a mathematical model that minimizes the total cost of purchasing foods while satisfying the nutritional requirements. Let's write this model in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Minimizing Food Cost}

\textbf{Objective:}
Minimize the total purchase cost of foods:

\[
\min \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{price}_k \cdot \text{quantity}_k
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}

For each nutrient \( m \), ensure that the nutritional demand is met:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{nutri}_{k, m} \cdot \text{quantity}_k \geq \text{demand}_m \quad \text{for } m = 1, \ldots, M
\]

\textbf{Decision Variables:}

\[
\text{quantity}_k \geq 0 \quad \text{for } k = 1, \ldots, K
\]

In this model:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\text{price}_k\) is the cost of one unit of food \( k \).
    \item \(\text{demand}_m\) is the required amount of nutrient \( m \).
    \item \(\text{nutri}_{k, m}\) is the amount of nutrient \( m \) in one unit of food \( k \).
    \item \(\text{quantity}_k\) is the amount of food \( k \) to purchase.
\end{itemize}

This linear programming model can be solved using optimization software to determine the optimal quantities of each food to purchase, thus minimizing the total cost while meeting all nutritional demands.
