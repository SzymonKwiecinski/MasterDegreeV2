PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- The town has \var{S} different shifts for the police officers during the day.
- During each shift \var{s}, the town requires \var{officers_needed_{s}} police officers on duty.
- Each police officer works for two consecutive shifts.
- The cost for the town when starting a shift at \var{s} is \var{shift_cost_{s}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "officers_needed": [officers_needed_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "shift_costs": [shift_cost_{s} for s in 1, ..., S]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many officers should the town assign to each shift in order to minimize the total cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- The number of officers assigned to each shift \var{officers_assigned_{s}}.
- \var{total_cost} indicates the total cost for the town.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "officers_assigned": [officers_assigned_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we need to develop a linear programming model that minimizes the total cost of assigning police officers to shifts, while meeting the demand for officers in each shift. Each officer works in two consecutive shifts.

######### Decision Variables:
- \( x_s \): The number of officers starting their shift at shift \( s \).

######### Parameters:
- \( \text{officers\_needed}_s \): The number of officers needed for shift \( s \).
- \( \text{shift\_cost}_s \): The cost associated with starting an officer at shift \( s \).
- \( S \): The total number of shifts.

######### Objective:
Minimize the total cost of assigning officers:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{s=1}^{S} \text{shift\_cost}_s \cdot x_s
\]

######### Constraints:
For each shift \( s \), the number of officers on duty (two consecutive shifts) must be at least the number needed:

\[
x_s + x_{s-1} \geq \text{officers\_needed}_s \quad \forall s \in \{1, 2, \ldots, S\}
\]

Note: For the first shift, \( x_{s-1} \) corresponds to \( x_S \), forming a circular dependency for shift covering.

The constraints ensure that the number of officers on duty meets the required demand in each shift by using officers starting in the current or previous shift. 

Now, let's write this in a LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

\subsection*{Objective}

Minimize the total cost associated with assigning officers:
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{s=1}^{S} \text{shift\_cost}_s \cdot x_s
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

For each shift \( s \), ensure that the number of assigned officers meets the required demand:
\[
x_s + x_{s-1} \geq \text{officers\_needed}_s \quad \forall s \in \{1, 2, \ldots, S\}
\]

\subsection*{Boundary Conditions}
The decision variables must be non-negative integers:
\[
x_s \geq 0 \quad \text{and integer} \quad \forall s \in \{1, 2, \ldots, S\}
\]

\end{document}
```

This model can be solved using a linear programming solver to obtain the number of officers needed to be assigned to each shift and the total cost incurred.
