\section*{Mathematical Model}

\textbf{Sets:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( K \): Set of departments, indexed by \( k \).
    \item \( L \): Set of possible locations (including London), indexed by \( l \).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{benefit}_{k,l} \): Benefit (in thousands of pounds) for relocating department \( k \) to city \( l \).
    \item \( \text{communication}_{k,j} \): Communication requirement between department \( k \) and department \( j \).
    \item \( \text{cost}_{l,m} \): Unit cost of communication between city \( l \) and city \( m \).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{islocated}_{k,l} \): Binary variable that equals 1 if department \( k \) is located at city \( l \), and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective Function:}
The objective is to minimize the overall yearly cost, which is the sum of the communication costs minus the relocation benefits.
\[
\min \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( \sum_{j=1}^{K} \sum_{m=1}^{L} \text{communication}_{k,j} \times \text{cost}_{l,m} \times \text{islocated}_{k,l} \times \text{islocated}_{j,m} \right) - \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{benefit}_{k,l} \times \text{islocated}_{k,l}
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each department \( k \) must be located in exactly one city:
    \[
    \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{islocated}_{k,l} = 1, \quad \forall k \in K
    \]

    \item No more than three departments can be located in the same city:
    \[
    \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{islocated}_{k,l} \leq 3, \quad \forall l \in L
    \]

    \item Binary constraint on the decision variables:
    \[
    \text{islocated}_{k,l} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall k \in K, \forall l \in L
    \]
\end{itemize}
