<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"benefit": [[benefit_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...,K],
	"communication": [[communication_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
	"cost": [[cost_{l, m} for m in 1,...,L] for l in 1,...,L],
}


OBJECTIVE: Where should each department be located so as to minimize overall yearly cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{islocated_{k, l}} represents whether department \var{k} is relocated at city \var{l}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "islocated": [[islocated_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...K],
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To create a mathematical model for the given problem, we will define a mixed-integer programming model. The goal is to determine the optimal location for each department such that the overall yearly cost (which includes relocation benefits and communication costs) is minimized. 

The decision variables, constraints, and objective function will be presented in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Model}

\textbf{Sets:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( K \): Set of departments, indexed by \( k \).
    \item \( L \): Set of possible locations (including London), indexed by \( l \).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{benefit}_{k,l} \): Benefit (in thousands of pounds) for relocating department \( k \) to city \( l \).
    \item \( \text{communication}_{k,j} \): Communication requirement between department \( k \) and department \( j \).
    \item \( \text{cost}_{l,m} \): Unit cost of communication between city \( l \) and city \( m \).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{islocated}_{k,l} \): Binary variable that equals 1 if department \( k \) is located at city \( l \), and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective Function:}
The objective is to minimize the overall yearly cost, which is the sum of the communication costs minus the relocation benefits.
\[
\min \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( \sum_{j=1}^{K} \sum_{m=1}^{L} \text{communication}_{k,j} \times \text{cost}_{l,m} \times \text{islocated}_{k,l} \times \text{islocated}_{j,m} \right) - \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{benefit}_{k,l} \times \text{islocated}_{k,l}
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each department \( k \) must be located in exactly one city:
    \[
    \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{islocated}_{k,l} = 1, \quad \forall k \in K
    \]

    \item No more than three departments can be located in the same city:
    \[
    \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{islocated}_{k,l} \leq 3, \quad \forall l \in L
    \]

    \item Binary constraint on the decision variables:
    \[
    \text{islocated}_{k,l} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall k \in K, \forall l \in L
    \]
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

This linear programming model captures the key elements of the problem: it accounts for the benefits of relocating departments, the costs associated with communication, and the constraints on department locations. The objective function aims to minimize the total costs while ensuring all constraints are met.
