PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- To operate a cafeteria, the manager must ensure on-call duty based on the statistics on the required staff. 
- In the future days, the number of desired employees on day \var{n} is denoted with \var{num_{n}}.
- Each employee works \var{n_working_days} days in a row and then has \var{n_resting_days} days off.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"num": [num_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"n_working_days": n_working_days,
	"n_resting_days": n_resting_days
}


OBJECTIVE: Calculate the minimum number of employees to hire

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_number} represents the total number of employees to employ
- \var{is_work} represents whether employee is working a rest on each day. Its length is determined by \var{total_number}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"total_number": total_number,
	"is_work": [[is_work_{n, i} for n in 1,...,N] for i in 1,...,total_number]

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of employees who can cover the required staffing needs over a given period, taking into account the working and resting schedule. We will use an integer linear programming (ILP) approach to satisfy the daily employee requirements with the constraint that each employee works for a fixed number of consecutive days and then rests for a fixed number of consecutive days.

Let's define the decision variables and constraints for this problem:

- Decision Variables:
  - \( x_i \): Binary indicator variable for employee \( i \) to determine if they start working on the first day of the schedule.
  - \( y_{i,n} \): Binary variable to indicate if employee \( i \) is working on day \( n \).

- Constraints:
  - Ensure that the required number of employees is met on each day.
  - Ensure the working and resting schedule for each employee.

\begin{document}

\textbf{Mathematical Model:}

\textbf{Given Data:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( N \) be the total number of days.
    \item Let \( \text{num}[n] \) denote the desired number of employees on day \( n \).
    \item Let \( n_{\text{working\_days}} \) be the number of consecutive working days.
    \item Let \( n_{\text{resting\_days}} \) be the number of consecutive resting days.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_i \in \{0, 1\} \): Binary variable, where \( x_i = 1 \) if employee \( i \) is employed, otherwise 0.
    \item \( y_{i,n} \in \{0, 1\} \): Binary variable indicating if employee \( i \) works on day \( n \).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective:}

Minimize the total number of employees:
\[
\min \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} x_i
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}

1. Ensure that the number of employees working each day meets the requirement:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} y_{i,n} \geq \text{num}[n] \quad \forall n = 1, 2, \ldots, N
\]

2. Enforce working and resting schedule constraints for each employee:
   - If employee \( i \) works on day \( d \), they must continue working for \( n_{\text{working\_days}} \) and then rest for \( n_{\text{resting\_days}} \).
\[
\begin{aligned}
    &y_{i,n} \leq x_i &&\quad \forall i, \forall n \\
    &y_{i,n} = 0 \quad \text{if } \left((n - d) \mod (n_{\text{working\_days}} + n_{\text{resting\_days}}) \geq n_{\text{working\_days}}\right)
\end{aligned}
\]

The model considers hiring the minimum number of employees while covering daily staffing needs and maintaining the working/resting schedules.

\end{document}
```

This mathematical model captures the essence of minimizing the number of employees while ensuring the daily staffing needs are met. Each employee can work and rest in cycles, for which constraints are established. The count of employees is minimized under these constraints.
