<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), we aim to minimize the number of floppy disks used while ensuring that the total file size on each disk does not exceed its capacity. Here's the MILP formulation in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{MILP Formulation for Floppy Disk Backup Problem}

\subsection*{Sets and Indices}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $j \in \{1, \ldots, N\}$: Index for files, where $N$ is the total number of files.
    \item $i \in \{1, \ldots, N\}$: Index for disks (at most $N$ disks are needed if each file is on a separate disk).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $capacity$: Capacity of each floppy disk (in GB).
    \item $size_j$: Size of file $j$ (in GB).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}$: Binary variable, where $x_{ij} = 1$ if file $j$ is assigned to disk $i$, and 0 otherwise.
    \item $y_i \in \{0, 1\}$: Binary variable, where $y_i = 1$ if disk $i$ is used, and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the number of disks used:
\[
\min \sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each file must be placed on exactly one disk:
    \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{ij} = 1, \quad \forall j \in \{1, \ldots, N\}
    \]
    
    \item The total size of files on each disk must not exceed its capacity:
    \[
    \sum_{j=1}^{N} size_j \cdot x_{ij} \leq capacity \cdot y_i, \quad \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, N\}
    \]
    
    \item A disk $i$ is used if at least one file is assigned to it:
    \[
    x_{ij} \leq y_i, \quad \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, N\}, \forall j \in \{1, \ldots, N\}
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Model Description}
This MILP model seeks to distribute the files across a set of floppy disks in a way that minimizes the number of disks used. The constraints ensure that no disk exceeds its capacity and that each file is assigned to exactly one disk. The decision variable $y_i$ indicates whether disk $i$ is used.

\end{document}
```

This LaTeX document accurately represents the MILP formulation for determining the optimal distribution of files across floppy disks while minimizing the number of disks used.
