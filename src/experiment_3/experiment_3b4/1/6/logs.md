PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT:

    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,

}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the total fuel \sum_{t=0}^{\var{T}-1} |\var{a_t}| spent subject to the preceding constraints.

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "fuel_spend" contains the total fuel spent by the rocket

OUTPUT FORMAT:

    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "v": [v_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "a": [a_i for i in 1, ..., T],

To solve the given problem, we can formulate it as a Linear Programming (LP) problem. We want to minimize the total fuel consumption, which is proportional to the sum of absolute values of the acceleration at each time step. Below is the mathematical model and the corresponding LaTeX code for the LP formulation:

######### Decision Variables:
- \( x_t \): Position of the rocket at time \( t \).
- \( v_t \): Velocity of the rocket at time \( t \).
- \( a_t \): Acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \).
- \( u_t \): Auxiliary variable to handle the absolute value of \( a_t \), where \( u_t \geq |a_t| \).

######### Objective Function:
Minimize the total fuel consumption:
\[ \text{minimize} \quad \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} u_t \]

######### Constraints:
1. Initial conditions:
   \[
   x_0 = \text{given initial position}
   \]
   \[
   v_0 = \text{given initial velocity}
   \]

2. Dynamics equations for \( t = 0, \ldots, T-1 \):
   \[
   x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t
   \]
   \[
   v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
   \]

3. Final conditions:
   \[
   x_T = \text{given target position}
   \]
   \[
   v_T = \text{given target velocity}
   \]

4. Absolute value constraints:
   \[
   u_t \geq a_t, \quad u_t \geq -a_t
   \]

The following is the LaTeX representation of the LP model:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Rocket Control}

\subsection*{Objective:}

Minimize the total fuel consumption:
\[
\min \quad \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} u_t
\]

\subsection*{Subject to:}

\begin{align*}
& \text{Initial conditions:} \\
& x_0 = x_0 \quad \text{(given initial position)} \\
& v_0 = v_0 \quad \text{(given initial velocity)} \\

& \text{Dynamics equations for } t = 0, \ldots, T-1: \\
& x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t \\
& v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t \\

& \text{Final conditions:} \\
& x_T = x_T \quad \text{(given target position)} \\
& v_T = v_T \quad \text{(given target velocity)} \\

& \text{Absolute value constraints:} \\
& u_t \geq a_t, \quad u_t \geq -a_t \quad \text{for } t = 0, \ldots, T-1.
\end{align*}

\end{document}
```

This LP model can be solved using any standard linear programming solver to find the optimal sequences of positions, velocities, accelerations, and the total fuel consumption over the given time period.
