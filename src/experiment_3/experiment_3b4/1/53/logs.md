PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
        for id in 1, ..., m
    ],
    "total_cost": total_cost

To solve this transportation problem using Linear Programming, we need to establish a mathematical model. Our objective is to minimize the transportation cost while satisfying the supply constraints of each terminal and the demand requirements of each destination.

Below is the linear programming model for the problem described:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Model}

\subsection*{Indices}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( k \): index for source terminals.
    \item \( p \): index for port cities.
    \item \( l \): index for destination cities.
    \item \( i, j \): indices for the cities in the transportation route network.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( C_{i,j} \): transportation cost per metric ton from city \( i \) to city \( j \).
    \item \( supply_{k} \): supply of soybeans available at terminal city \( k \).
    \item \( demand_{l} \): demand for soybeans at destination city \( l \).
    \item \( A \): set of all possible routes (i, j).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( amount_{i,j} \): quantity of soybeans shipped from city \( i \) to city \( j \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total transportation cost:
\[
\text{Minimize } \quad \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \times amount_{i,j}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Supply constraints for each terminal \( k \):
    \[
    \sum_{j \mid (k,j) \in A} amount_{k,j} \leq supply_{k} \quad \forall k
    \]
    \item Demand constraints for each destination \( l \):
    \[
    \sum_{i \mid (i,l) \in A} amount_{i,l} \geq demand_{l} \quad \forall l
    \]
    \item Non-negativity constraints:
    \[
    amount_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \forall (i,j) \in A
    \]
\end{itemize}

This linear programming model can be solved using standard optimization software or solvers like CPLEX, Gurobi, or open-source options such as PuLP in Python to obtain the optimal distribution of soybeans from source to destination while minimizing costs.

This LATEX document outlines the linear program's mathematical formulation, including its objective function and constraints, which is necessary to solve the transportation network problem efficiently.
