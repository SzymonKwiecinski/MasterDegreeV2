PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

To create a linear programming model for the given problem, we need to minimize the total travel time while adhering to the constraints on movements (either north or west). Below is the mathematical formulation in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Optimal Path}

\textbf{Objective:} Minimize the total travel time from the intersection of 1st Avenue and 1st Street to the intersection of \(W\)th Avenue and \(N\)th Street.

\textbf{Let:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(x_{n,w}\) be the binary decision variable for moving west from the intersection of \(w\)th Avenue and \(n\)th Street.
    \item \(y_{n,w}\) be the binary decision variable for moving north from the intersection of \(w\)th Avenue and \(n\)th Street.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function:}

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} \text{west\_time}_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w} + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W} \text{north\_time}_{n,w} \cdot y_{n,w}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints:}

\begin{align*}
&\text{Flow Conservation:} \\
&x_{n,w} + y_{n,w} = 1, \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}, \forall w \in \{1, \ldots, W\}\\
&\text{North Movement Constraints:} \\
&\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} y_{n,w} = N-1, \quad \forall w \in \{1, \ldots, W\}\\
&\text{West Movement Constraints:} \\
&\sum_{w=1}^{W-1} x_{n,w} = W-1, \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}\\
&\text{Initial and Terminal Conditions:} \\
&x_{1,1} = 0, \quad y_{1,1} = 0\\
&x_{N,W-1} = 1, \quad y_{N,W} = 1
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Binary Variables:}

\[
x_{n,w}, y_{n,w} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall n, w
\]

\end{document}
```

In this model:
- The objective function minimizes the total travel time by summing the time spent in each west and north move, weighted by the respective times `west_time_{n,w}` and `north_time_{n,w}`.
- The flow conservation constraint ensures that the delivery person either moves north or west from each intersection, but not both.
- The north and west movement constraints limit the total number of moves in each direction to fit the grid constraints.
- Initial and terminal conditions enforce starting and ending at the correct intersections.
- Binary variables represent the decision to take a particular path direction at each grid point.
