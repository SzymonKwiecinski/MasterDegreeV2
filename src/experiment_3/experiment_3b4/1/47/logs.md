PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- The town has \var{S} different shifts for the police officers during the day.
- During each shift \var{s}, the town requires \var{officers_needed_{s}} police officers on duty.
- Each police officer works for two consecutive shifts.
- The cost for the town when starting a shift at \var{s} is \var{shift_cost_{s}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "officers_needed": [officers_needed_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "shift_costs": [shift_cost_{s} for s in 1, ..., S]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many officers should the town assign to each shift in order to minimize the total cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- The number of officers assigned to each shift \var{officers_assigned_{s}}.
- \var{total_cost} indicates the total cost for the town.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "officers_assigned": [officers_assigned_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem, we will use a Linear Programming (LP) approach. We will define decision variables, constraints, and an objective function to minimize the total cost. Here's the mathematical model in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Model}

\subsection*{Indices and Sets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( S \): Number of shifts in a day.
    \item \( s \): Index for shifts, \( s = 1, 2, \ldots, S \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{officers\_needed}$_s$: Number of officers required for shift \( s \).
    \item \texttt{shift\_cost}$_s$: Cost of starting a shift at \( s \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_s \): Number of officers starting at shift \( s \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective}
Minimize the total cost for assigning officers to shifts:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{s=1}^{S} \texttt{shift\_cost}_s \cdot x_s
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
Each shift \( s \) must have the required number of officers, considering that each officer works for two consecutive shifts:
\[
x_s + x_{s-1} \geq \texttt{officers\_needed}_s, \quad \forall s = 1, 2, \ldots, S
\]
*Note: For the first shift, assume \( x_0 = x_S \) to account for the cyclic nature of shifts.*

\subsection*{Non-negativity}
\[
x_s \geq 0, \quad \forall s = 1, 2, \ldots, S
\]

\end{document}
```

This model assumes that the shifts are cyclic, such that the last shift in the list connects back to the first shift. The decision variable \( x_s \) represents the number of officers starting at shift \( s \), and the total number of officers on duty during shift \( s \) must satisfy or exceed the requirement defined in \texttt{officers\_needed} for each shift. The objective is to minimize the sum of the products of \texttt{shift\_cost} and \( x_s \).
