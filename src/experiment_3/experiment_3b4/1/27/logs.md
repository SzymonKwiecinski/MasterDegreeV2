PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"benefit": [[benefit_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...,K],
	"communication": [[communication_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
	"cost": [[cost_{l, m} for m in 1,...,L] for l in 1,...,L],
}


OBJECTIVE: Where should each department be located so as to minimize overall yearly cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{islocated_{k, l}} represents whether department \var{k} is relocated at city \var{l}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "islocated": [[islocated_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...K],
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To formulate this problem as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem, we need to define our decision variables, objective function, and constraints in the LATEX format. Let's denote:

- \( K \) as the number of departments.
- \( L \) as the number of possible locations (including London).
- \( \text{benefit}_{k, l} \) as the benefit of relocating department \( k \) to city \( l \).
- \( \text{communication}_{k, j} \) as the communication requirement between department \( k \) and department \( j \).
- \( \text{cost}_{l, m} \) as the communication cost between city \( l \) and city \( m \).
- \( \text{islocated}_{k, l} \) as a binary decision variable where \(\text{islocated}_{k, l} = 1\) if department \( k \) is located in city \( l\), and \(0\) otherwise.

The objective is to minimize the overall yearly cost, which is the negative of benefits plus communication costs. The constraints ensure that no more than three departments are relocated to any city, and that each department is relocated to exactly one city.

Here is the mathematical formulation in LATEX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Mathematical Model: MIP Formulation}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\[
\text{islocated}_{k, l} = 
\begin{cases} 
1, & \text{if department } k \text{ is relocated to city } l \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\textbf{Objective Function:}

Minimize:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} -\text{benefit}_{k, l} \cdot \text{islocated}_{k, l} 
+ \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{j=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{m=1}^{L} \text{communication}_{k, j} \cdot \text{cost}_{l, m} \cdot \text{islocated}_{k, l} \cdot \text{islocated}_{j, m}
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}

1. Each department must be relocated to exactly one city:
\[
\sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{islocated}_{k, l} = 1 \quad \forall k \in \{1, \ldots, K\}
\]

2. No city can host more than 3 departments:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{islocated}_{k, l} \leq 3 \quad \forall l \in \{1, \ldots, L\}
\]

3. Binary constraints:
\[
\text{islocated}_{k, l} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall k \in \{1, \ldots, K\}, \forall l \in \{1, \ldots, L\}
\]

\end{document}
```

This LATEX code encapsulates the entire MIP formulation needed to solve the problem of minimizing the overall yearly cost of relocating company departments, taking into account both benefits from relocation and communication costs.
