PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A quantity y is known to depend on another quantity x. A set of corresponding values has been collected for x and y and is presented.
- The \var{k}-th y value takes \var{y_{k}} and the \var{k}-th x value takes \var{x_{k}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "y": [y_{k} for k = 1,...,K],
    "x": [x_{k} for k = 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Fit the ‘best’ straight line y = bx + a where the objective is to minimize the maximum deviation of all the observed values of y from the value predicted by the linear relationship.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{intercept} represents the intercept of the fitted line
- \var{slope} represents the slope of the fitted line

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}

To solve this problem, we need to find the best fit line \( y = bx + a \) by minimizing the maximum deviation (Chebyshev approximation) between the observed values \( y_k \) and the predicted values \( bx_k + a \). This can be set up as a linear programming problem.

The mathematical model for this problem is as follows:

Minimize \(\max_{k} \left| y_k - (bx_k + a) \right|\).

This can be reformulated using linear programming by introducing an auxiliary variable \( t \) to replace the maximum deviation:

Minimize \( t \).

Subject to:
\[
y_k - (bx_k + a) \leq t,  \quad \forall k
\]
\[
(bx_k + a) - y_k \leq t,  \quad \forall k
\]

Let's construct this linear programming model in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

Objective:
\[
\min t
\]

Subject to the constraints:
\[
y_k - (bx_k + a) \leq t, \quad \forall k 
\]
\[
(bx_k + a) - y_k \leq t, \quad \forall k
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( y_k \) are the observed values of \( y \).
    \item \( x_k \) are the observed values of \( x \).
    \item \( a \) is the intercept of the fitted line.
    \item \( b \) is the slope of the fitted line.
    \item \( t \) is the auxiliary variable representing the maximum deviation.
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

This model can be solved using a linear programming solver to obtain the values of the intercept \( a \) and slope \( b \) that minimize the maximum deviation.
