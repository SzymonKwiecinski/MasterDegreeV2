PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- A hospital wants to make a weekly night shift (12pm-8am) schedule for its nurses. 
- The demand for nurses for the night shift on day \var{j} = 1,...,7 is an integer \var{d_j}. 
- Every nurse works \var{period} days in a row on the night shift, followed by (7 - \var{period}) days off.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "period": period,
    "demand": [d_j for j in 1, ...,7]
}

OBJECTIVE: The goal is to find the minimal number of nurses the hospital needs to hire. 

OUTPUT INFO: 

- for each day \var{j} = 1,...,7, \var{start_j} which shows the number of nurses that start their period on day \var{j}.
- the total number of nurses hired.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "start": [start_j for j in 1, ...,7],
    "total": total
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, we'll define decision variables, constraints, and the objective function in a mathematical formulation.

######### Decision Variables:
- Let \( x_j \) be the number of nurses who start their shift period on day \( j \), for \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \). These are integer variables.

######### Objective:
- Minimize the total number of nurses hired, i.e., \( \sum_{j=1}^{7} x_j \).

######### Constraints:
- For each day \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \), we need to satisfy the demand \( d_j \):
  - The nurses working on day \( j \) are those who started their period \( \text{period} \) days before and are currently within their scheduled working days. 
  - The demand constraint for day \( j \) is:
    \[
    \sum_{i=0}^{\text{period} - 1} x_{(j-i-1) \mod 7 + 1} \geq d_j
    \]
  - The above expression accounts for the cyclic nature of the week.

Now, I'll provide the LaTeX code for this MILP formulation:

```latex

\section*{MILP Model for Nurse Night Shift Scheduling}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let \( x_j \) be the integer number of nurses who start their shift period on day \( j \), where \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total number of nurses:
\[
\min \sum_{j=1}^{7} x_j
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
For each day \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \), ensure that the demand \( d_j \) is met:
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{\text{period} - 1} x_{(j-i-1) \mod 7 + 1} \geq d_j \quad \forall \, j = 1, \ldots, 7
\]

\subsection*{Variable Domain}
\[
x_j \geq 0 \quad \text{and integer} \quad \forall \, j = 1, \ldots, 7
\]

\end{document}
```

This is a complete and correct MILP model for scheduling nurses in a hospital to cover weekly night shift demands while minimizing the number of nurses hired.
