PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements in future years. 
- Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. 
- In addition to this, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, which will reduce the need for workers in all categories.
- The estimated manpower requirements for manpower \var{k} in year \var{i} is \var{requirement_{k, i}}.
- The current strength of manpower \var{k} is \var{strength_{k}}.
- The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to recruitment, retraining, redundancy and short-time working in the next years.
- There is a natural wastage of labour. 
- A fairly large number of workers leave during their first year. After this, the rate is much smaller. 
- Taking this into account, the wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with less than one year's service is \var{lessonewaste_{k}}.
- The wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with more than one year's service is \var{moreonewaste_{k}}.
- There has been no recent recruitment and all workers in the current labour force have been employed for more than one year.
- It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. 
- In any one year, the numbers that can be recruited in manpower \var{k} is \var{recruit_{k}}.
- The redundancy payment to manpower \var{k} is \var{costredundancy_{k}}.
- It is possible to employ up to \var{num_overman} more workers over the whole company than are needed, but the extra costs per employee per year is \var{costoverman_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- Up to \var{num_shortwork} workers in each category of skill can be put on short-time working. 
- The cost of this (per employee per year) is \var{costshort_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of half a full-time employee.

    \item $lessonewaste_{k}$: Wastage rate for manpower type $k$ with less than one year's service.
    \item $moreonewaste_{k}$: Wastage rate for manpower type $k$ with more than one year's service.

    \item $costoverman_{k}$: Extra cost for each overmanned employee per year for manpower type $k$.
    \item $num\_shortwork$: Maximum number of workers that can be put on short-time working in each category.
    \item $costshort_{k}$: Cost per short-time employee per year for manpower type $k$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{k,i}$: Number of manpower type $k$ recruited in year $i$.
    \item $y_{k,i}$: Number of manpower type $k$ on short-time working in year $i$.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective:}
Minimize the total cost:
\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{i=1}^{I} \left( costredundancy_{k} \cdot r_{k,i} + costoverman_{k} \cdot z_{k,i} + costshort_{k} \cdot y_{k,i} \right)
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Manpower Balance:}

    For each $k$, $i$:
    \[
    (1 - moreonewaste_{k}) \cdot (\text{Existing Strength + Previous Year Balance}) + x_{k,i} \cdot (1 - lessonewaste_{k}) + y_{k,i} \cdot 0.5 - r_{k,i} \geq requirement_{k,i} - z_{k,i}
    \]

    \item \textbf{Recruitment Limits:}

    For each $k$, $i$:
    \[
    x_{k,i} \leq recruit_{k}
    \]

    \item \textbf{Overmanning Limits:}

    \]

    \item \textbf{Short-time Working Limits:}

    For each $k$, $i$:
    \[
    y_{k,i} \leq num\_shortwork
    \]

    \item \textbf{Non-negativity:}

    For each $k$, $i$:
    \[
    x_{k,i}, y_{k,i}, z_{k,i}, r_{k,i} \geq 0
    \]
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

This linear programming model incorporates the recruitment, redundancy, overmanning, and short-time working aspects to minimize the total cost while satisfying the manpower requirements over the years. Constraints ensure that limits on redundancies, recruitment, overmanning, and short-time working are adhered to, while the objective function sums up all cost factors involved.
