PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- Consider a set \var{P} described by linear inequality constraints, that is:
 \var{P} = {\var{x} \in R^\var{N} | \var{a_i}^T x <= \var{b_i} , i = 1, ..., m}.

where \var{a_i} \in R^\var{N} and \var{b_i} \in R

- A ball with center \var{y} in R^\var{N} and radius \var{r} is defined as the set of all points within (Euclidean) distance \var{r} from \var{y}.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "A": [[a_i_j for j in 1, ..., n] for i in 1, ..., m],
    "b": [b_i for i in 1, ..., m]
}

OBJECTIVE: We are interested in finding a ball with the largest possible radius, which is entirely contained within the set \var{P} (The center of such a ball is called the Chebychev center of \var{P}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- center (list): The center of the ball as a list of floats of length \var{N}
- radius (float): The radius of the ball as a float

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "center": [y_j for j in 1, ..., n],
    "radius": r
}

To find the Chebyshev center of the polyhedron \( P \) described by the given linear inequality constraints, we need to formulate an LP problem that maximizes the radius of a ball centered at \( y \) and contained within \( P \).

The Chebyshev center \( y \) is the center of the largest ball inscribed in the polyhedron \( P \). This problem can be formulated using the following linear program:

Given the polyhedron \( P = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^N \mid A x \leq b \} \), where \( A \) is an \( m \times N \) matrix and \( b \) is a vector of length \( m \), the goal is to find the center \( y \) and maximum radius \( r \) of a ball contained within \( P \).

######### Linear Programming Formulation

The LP formulation is:
- Variables: \( y \in \mathbb{R}^N \), \( r \in \mathbb{R} \).
- Objective: Maximize \( r \).
- Constraints:
  - \( a_i^T y + \|a_i\| r \leq b_i \), for all \( i = 1, \ldots, m \).

Below is the LaTeX formulation of this optimization problem:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Linear Programming Formulation:}

\begin{align*}
& \text{Maximize} && r \\
& \text{subject to} && a_i^T y + \|a_i\| r \leq b_i, \quad \text{for } i = 1, \ldots, m, \\
& && r \geq 0.
\end{align*}

\text{Here, \( y \in \mathbb{R}^N \) is the center of the ball and \( r \) is its radius. The term \(\|a_i\|\) represents the Euclidean norm of the vector \( a_i \).}

\end{document}
```

This formulation ensures that the distance from the center \( y \) to each hyperplane \( a_i^T x = b_i \) is at least \( r \). By maximizing \( r \), we obtain the largest possible ball completely contained within \( P \).

To solve this problem, you would use a linear programming solver after suitably encoding the above constraints with your input data.
