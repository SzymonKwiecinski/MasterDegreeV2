PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Suppose that there are \var{N} available currencies, and assume that one unit of currency \var{i} can be exchanged for \var{rate_{i,j}} units of currency \var{j} (Naturally, we assume that \var{rate_{i,j}} > 0).
- There are also certain regulations that impose a limit \var{limit_i} on the total amount of currency \var{i} that can be exchanged (whether to other currencies or from other currencies) on any given day.
- Suppose that we start the day with \var{start_i} units of currency \var{i}
- Provide a linear programming formulation of this problem. Assume that for any sequence \var{i_1}, â€¦ ,\var{i_k} of currencies, we have \var{rate_{i_1,i_2}}, \var{rate_{i_2,i_3}}, ..., \var{rate_{i_{k-1}, i_{k}}, \var{rate_{i_k, i_1}} <= 1, which means that wealth cannot be multiplied by going through a cycle of currencies.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "start": [start_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "limit": [limit_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "rate": [[rate_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., N] for i in 1, ..., N],
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to maximize the number of units of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day, through a sequence of currency transactions.

OUTPUT INFO: 

- The output json file contains a list of transactions, where each transaction is a json object with the following fields:
    - from: the currency that we are exchanging from
    - to: the currency that we are exchanging to
    - amount: the amount of currency that we are exchanging
- The output json file also contains the final amount of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day.

OUTPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": i,
            "to": j,
            "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
    ],
    "final_amount_of_currency_N": final_amount_of_currency_N

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem as a Linear Programming (LP) problem, we need to define the decision variables, the objective function, and the set of constraints. The goal is to maximize the amount of the last currency \( N \) by performing currency exchanges subject to given rates and limits.

######### Decision Variables

Let \( x_{i,j} \) represent the amount of currency \( i \) that is exchanged for currency \( j \).

######### Objective Function

The objective is to maximize the final amount of currency \( N \):

\[
\text{Maximize: } \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} x_{i,N} \cdot \text{rate}_{i,N} + \text{start}_N - \sum_{j=1}^{N-1} x_{N,j}
\]

######### Constraints

1. **Currency Balance Constraints**: For each currency \( i \) (except the last one), the amount exchanged should not exceed the starting amount plus incoming exchanges:

   \[
   \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} \leq \text{start}_i + \sum_{k=1}^{N} x_{k,i} \cdot \text{rate}_{k,i} \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, \ldots, N
   \]

2. **Limit Constraints**: For each currency \( i \), the total amount exchanged should not exceed its limit:

   \[
   \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} \leq \text{limit}_i \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, \ldots, N
   \]

3. **Non-Negativity Constraints**: All exchange amounts should be non-negative:

   \[
   x_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } i, j
   \]

Below is the complete Linear Programming formulation in LaTeX.

\[
Z = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} x_{i,N} \cdot \text{rate}_{i,N} + \text{start}_N - \sum_{j=1}^{N-1} x_{N,j}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. Currency Balance Constraints:
   \[
   \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} \leq \text{start}_i + \sum_{k=1}^{N} x_{k,i} \cdot \text{rate}_{k,i} \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, \ldots, N
   \]

2. Limit Constraints:
   \[
   \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} \leq \text{limit}_i \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, \ldots, N
   \]

3. Non-Negativity Constraints:
   \[
   x_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } i, j
   \]

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\( x_{i,j} \): Amount of currency \( i \) exchanged for currency \( j \).

\end{document}
```

This formulation captures the key objectives and constraints of the problem, modeling it as a linear programming problem to determine optimal currency transactions.
