PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }

\section*{Mathematical Model for Soybean Transportation}

We are given a transportation network with the following components: 
- Terminal cities denoted by $k$
- Port cities denoted by $p$
- Destination cities denoted by $l$
- Transportation routes $A$ with associated costs $C_{i,j}$ for transporting soybeans from city $i$ to city $j$

\subsection*{Objective}
The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost while satisfying supply and demand constraints.

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let $x_{i,j}$ be the quantity of soybeans transported from city $i$ to city $j$.

\subsection*{Objective Function}

The total cost $C$ to be minimized is given by the sum of the transportation costs across all routes:

\[
\text{Minimize } C = \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. \textbf{Supply Constraints:} Each terminal city $k$ should not send more soybeans than it has:

\[
\sum_{j \mid (k, j) \in A} x_{k,j} \leq \text{supply}_{k}, \quad \forall k
\]

2. \textbf{Demand Constraints:} Each destination city $l$ should receive the required demand:

\[
\sum_{i \mid (i, l) \in A} x_{i,l} = \text{demand}_{l}, \quad \forall l
\]

3. \textbf{Flow Balance Constraints: } For port city $p$, the inflow must equal the outflow:

\[
\sum_{i \mid (i, p) \in A} x_{i,p} = \sum_{j \mid (p, j) \in A} x_{p,j}, \quad \forall p
\]

4. \textbf{Non-negativity Constraints: } All transported quantities must be non-negative:

\[
x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall (i,j) \in A
\]
