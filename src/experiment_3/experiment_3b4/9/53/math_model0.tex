\section*{Mathematical Model for Soybean Transportation}

We are given a transportation network with the following components: 
- Terminal cities denoted by $k$
- Port cities denoted by $p$
- Destination cities denoted by $l$
- Transportation routes $A$ with associated costs $C_{i,j}$ for transporting soybeans from city $i$ to city $j$

\subsection*{Objective}
The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost while satisfying supply and demand constraints.

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let $x_{i,j}$ be the quantity of soybeans transported from city $i$ to city $j$.

\subsection*{Objective Function}

The total cost $C$ to be minimized is given by the sum of the transportation costs across all routes:

\[
\text{Minimize } C = \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. \textbf{Supply Constraints:} Each terminal city $k$ should not send more soybeans than it has:

\[
\sum_{j \mid (k, j) \in A} x_{k,j} \leq \text{supply}_{k}, \quad \forall k
\]

2. \textbf{Demand Constraints:} Each destination city $l$ should receive the required demand:

\[
\sum_{i \mid (i, l) \in A} x_{i,l} = \text{demand}_{l}, \quad \forall l
\]

3. \textbf{Flow Balance Constraints: } For port city $p$, the inflow must equal the outflow:

\[
\sum_{i \mid (i, p) \in A} x_{i,p} = \sum_{j \mid (p, j) \in A} x_{p,j}, \quad \forall p
\]

4. \textbf{Non-negativity Constraints: } All transported quantities must be non-negative:

\[
x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall (i,j) \in A
\]
