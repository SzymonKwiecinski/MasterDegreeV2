PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a road divided into \var{N} segments that is illuminated by \var{M} lamps.
- Let \var{power_j} be the power of the \var{j}-th lamp. The illumination \var{ill_i} of the \var{i}-th segment is assumed to be \sum_{j=1}^{\var{M}} \var{coeff_{i,j}} \var{power_j}, where \var{coeff_{i,j}} are known coefficients.
- Let \var{desired_i} be the desired illumination of road \var{i}. 
- We are interested in choosing the lamp powers \var{power_j} so that the illuminations {ill_i} are close to the desired illuminations {desired_i}. 

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "coeff": [[coeff_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., M] for i in 1, ..., N],
    "desired": [desired_i for i in 1, ..., N]
}

OBJECTIVE: Find the lamp powers \var{power_j} that minimize the absolute error between the illuminations {ill_i} and the desired illuminations {desired_i}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{power_j} is the optimal power of the \var{j}-th lamp.
- \var{error} is the absolute error between the illuminations {ill_i} and the desired illuminations {desired_i}.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "power": [power_j for j in 1, ..., M]
    "error": error
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model the given problem as a Linear Programming (LP) problem, we first need to define the variables and constraints based on the problem description. The objective is to minimize the absolute error between the calculated illumination of each segment and the desired illumination.

Let's denote:
- \( \text{power}_j \) as the decision variable representing the power of the \( j \)-th lamp.
- \( \text{ill}_i \) as the calculated illumination for the \( i \)-th segment.
- \( \text{coeff}_{i,j} \) as the known coefficient that determines the contribution of the \( j \)-th lamp to the \( i \)-th segment.
- \( \text{desired}_i \) as the desired illumination for the \( i \)-th segment.
- \( \text{error}_i \) as the absolute error for the \( i \)-th segment.

The mathematical model in linear programming terms is as follows:

Objective Function:
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{error}_i
\]

Subject to:
\[
\text{error}_i \geq \text{ill}_i - \text{desired}_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
\]
\[
\text{error}_i \geq -(\text{ill}_i - \text{desired}_i), \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
\]
\[
\text{ill}_i = \sum_{j=1}^{M} \text{coeff}_{i,j} \cdot \text{power}_j, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
\]
\[
\text{power}_j \geq 0, \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, M
\]

This ensures that the absolute error is minimized, taking into account both positive and negative deviations from the desired illumination.

Here is the complete model in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Optimal Lamp Powers}

\subsection*{Objective}
Minimize the total absolute error:
\[
\min \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{error}_i
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

For each segment \(i = 1, \ldots, N\):
\[
\text{error}_i \geq \sum_{j=1}^{M} \text{coeff}_{i,j} \cdot \text{power}_j - \text{desired}_i
\]
\[
\text{error}_i \geq -\left(\sum_{j=1}^{M} \text{coeff}_{i,j} \cdot \text{power}_j - \text{desired}_i\right)
\]

Non-negativity for lamp powers:
\[
\text{power}_j \geq 0, \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, M
\]

\end{document}
```

This model will guide the selection of lamp powers such that the illumination of each road segment closely matches the desired values while minimizing the overall error. Use this model with an LP solver to find the optimal solution.
