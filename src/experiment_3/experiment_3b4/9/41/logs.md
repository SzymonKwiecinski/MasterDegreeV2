<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

To model this problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) in LaTeX, we introduce some decision variables and constraints. The primary goal is to minimize the number of disks used to store all the files. Here's how we can formulate the problem:

1. **Decision Variables:**
   - \( x_{ij} \): A binary variable that equals 1 if file \( j \) is placed on disk \( i \), and 0 otherwise.
   - \( y_i \): A binary variable that equals 1 if disk \( i \) is used, and 0 otherwise.

2. **Parameters:**
   - \(\text{capacity}\): Capacity of each floppy disk.
   - \(\text{size}_j\): Size of file \( j \).

3. **Objective Function:**
   - Minimize the total number of disks used: \(\sum_{i} y_i\).

4. **Constraints:**
   - Each file must be placed on exactly one disk.
   - The sum of file sizes on each disk cannot exceed its capacity.
   - A disk is used if and only if it has at least one file assigned to it.

The mathematical formulation in LaTeX is as follows:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\begin{document}

\textbf{MILP Formulation:}

\begin{align*}
    \text{Minimize} \quad & \sum_{i} y_i \\
    \text{subject to} \quad & \sum_{j} x_{ij} \times \text{size}_j \leq \text{capacity} \cdot y_i, \quad \forall i \\
    & \sum_{i} x_{ij} = 1, \quad \forall j \\
    & x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall i, j \\
    & y_i \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall i
\end{align*}

\textbf{Explanation:}

- The objective function minimizes the total number of disks used: \(\sum_{i} y_i\).
- The first constraint ensures that the total size of files on each disk does not exceed the disk's capacity. 
- The second constraint ensures that each file \( j \) is assigned to exactly one disk \( i \).
- The binary variables \( x_{ij} \) determine if file \( j \) is placed on disk \( i \).
- The binary variables \( y_i \) indicate whether disk \( i \) is used.

\end{document}
```

This MILP can be solved using standard optimization solvers that support integer programming. The solution will provide the minimum number of disks needed and the allocation of each file to a disk.
