PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- The town has \var{S} different shifts for the police officers during the day.
- During each shift \var{s}, the town requires \var{officers_needed_{s}} police officers on duty.
- Each police officer works for two consecutive shifts.
- The cost for the town when starting a shift at \var{s} is \var{shift_cost_{s}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "officers_needed": [officers_needed_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "shift_costs": [shift_cost_{s} for s in 1, ..., S]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many officers should the town assign to each shift in order to minimize the total cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- The number of officers assigned to each shift \var{officers_assigned_{s}}.
- \var{total_cost} indicates the total cost for the town.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "officers_assigned": [officers_assigned_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

To address the problem of assigning police officers to shifts while minimizing costs, we can represent the problem as a Linear Programming (LP) model. Let's denote:

- \( x_s \) as the number of officers starting at shift \( s \).
- \( S \) as the total number of shifts.
- \( \text{officers\_needed}_{s} \) as the number of officers required during shift \( s \).
- \( \text{shift\_cost}_{s} \) as the cost of assigning officers to start at shift \( s \).

The objective is to minimize the total cost of assigning officers, while ensuring that the demand for officers during each shift is met. Each officer covers two consecutive shifts.

We can now write the LP model in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

\subsection*{Objective}

Minimize the total cost:
\[
\text{minimize} \quad \sum_{s=1}^{S} \text{shift\_cost}_s \times x_s
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

For each shift \( s \), ensure that the number of officers assigned meets the demand:

\[
x_s + x_{s-1} \geq \text{officers\_needed}_s, \quad \forall s = 1, \ldots, S
\]

Note: The indices should consider the circular nature of shifts if \( s = 1 \), \( x_0 \) corresponds to \( x_S \) if the last shift wraps around.

\subsection*{Variables}
\[
x_s \geq 0 \quad \text{and integer}, \quad \forall s = 1, \ldots, S
\]

\end{document}
```

This linear programming formulation captures the objective of minimizing costs while ensuring enough officers are present for each shift. The constraints ensure that the required number of officers is available during each shift by considering two consecutive shifts coverage.
