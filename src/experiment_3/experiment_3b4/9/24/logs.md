<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A mining company is going to continue operating in a certain area for the next years. 
- There are \var{n_mines} mines in this area, but it can operate at most \var{n_maxwork} in any one year. 
- Although a mine may not operate in a certain year, it is still necessary to keep it ‘open’, in the sense that royalties are payable, if it be operated in a future year. 
- Clearly, if a mine is not going to be worked again, it can be permanently closed down and no more royalties need be paid. 
- The yearly royalties payable on each mine kept ‘open’ is \var{royalty_{k}} for mine \var{k}.
- There is an upper limit to the amount of ore, which can be extracted from each mine in a year. 
- The upper limit for mine \var{k} is \var{limit_{k}}.
- The ore from the different mines is of varying quality.
- This quality is measured on a scale so that blending ores together results in a linear combination of the quality measurements, for example, if equal quantities of two ores were combined, the resultant ore would have a quality measurement half way between
that of the ingredient ores. 
- The quality of ore from mine \var{k} is \var{quality_{k}}.
- In each year, it is necessary to combine the total outputs from each mine to produce a blended ore of exactly some stipulated quality.
- In year \var{i}, the required quality is \var{requiredquality_{i}}.
- The final blended ore sells for \var{price} ton each year. 
- Revenue and expenditure for future years must be discounted at a rate of \var{discount} per annum.

INPUT FORMAT:

OBJECTIVE: To maximize profit, which mines should be operated each year and how much should they produce?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{isoperated} represents whether each mine is operated in each year
- \var{amount} represents the amount of ore produced by each mine in each year

    "isoperated": [[isoperated_{k, i} for i in 1,...,I] for k in 1,...K]

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem, we will formulate a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) model that maximizes the profit from mining operations over the given number of years. The decision variables will include binary variables to represent whether a mine is operated or not in a given year, and continuous variables to represent the amount of ore produced by each mine each year. We'll incorporate constraints for operational limits, quality requirements, and financial aspects such as royalties and discounting.

Below is the mathematical formulation of the given problem in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Model}

\subsection*{Indices and Parameters}
\begin{align*}
    &k: \text{Index for mines, } k = 1, \ldots, n\_mines\\
    &i: \text{Index for years, } i = 1, \ldots, I\\
    &\text{n\_maxwork}: \text{Maximum number of mines that can be operated in any year}\\
    &\text{royalty}_k: \text{Yearly royalties payable for mine } k\\
    &\text{limit}_k: \text{Upper limit of ore extraction for mine } k \text{ in a year}\\
    &\text{quality}_k: \text{Quality of ore from mine } k\\
    &\text{requiredquality}_i: \text{Required quality of blended ore in year } i\\
    &\text{price}: \text{Price per ton of the blended ore}\\
    &\text{discount}: \text{Discount rate per annum}
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{align*}
    &\text{isoperated}_{k,i} \in \{0, 1\}: \text{1 if mine } k \text{ is operated in year } i, \text{ 0 otherwise}\\
    &\text{amount}_{k,i} \geq 0: \text{The amount of ore produced by mine } k \text{ in year } i
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Maximize the present value of profit over all years:
\[
\max \sum_{i=1}^{I} \left( \frac{1}{(1 + \text{discount})^i} \left( \text{price} \sum_{k=1}^{n\_mines} \text{amount}_{k,i} - \sum_{k=1}^{n\_mines} \text{royalty}_k \cdot \text{isoperated}_{k,i} \right) \right)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Operating constraints per year:
    \[
    \sum_{k=1}^{n\_mines} \text{isoperated}_{k,i} \leq \text{n\_maxwork}, \quad \forall i
    \]
    \item Ore production constraints:
    \[
    \text{amount}_{k,i} \leq \text{limit}_k \cdot \text{isoperated}_{k,i}, \quad \forall k, i
    \]
    \item Quality blending constraint for each year:
    \[
    \sum_{k=1}^{n\_mines} \left( \text{quality}_k \cdot \text{amount}_{k,i} \right) = \text{requiredquality}_i \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{n\_mines} \text{amount}_{k,i}, \quad \forall i
    \]
    \item Non-negativity constraints:
    \[
    \text{amount}_{k,i} \geq 0, \quad \forall k, i
    \]
    \item Binary constraints:
    \[
    \text{isoperated}_{k,i} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall k, i
    \]
\end{enumerate}

\end{document}
```

This LaTeX document encapsulates the mathematical formulation for maximizing profit by determining which mines should be operated and how much they should produce given constraints on operations, quality, and financial considerations. The use of binary variables ensures that the mine is either open or closed, and constraints handle blending quality and the number of mines operated simultaneously.
