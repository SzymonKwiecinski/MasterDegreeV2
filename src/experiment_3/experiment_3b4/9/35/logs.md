PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Consider the problem of operating a warehouse, by buying and selling the stock of a certain commodity, in order to maximize profit over a certain length of time, say several periods.
- The warehouse has a fixed capacity \var{capacity}, and there is a cost \var{holding_cost} per unit for holding stock for one period.
- The selling price, \var{price_{n}}$, of the commodity is known to fluctuate over a number of time periods. 
- In any period \var{n} the price holding for purchase is \var{cost_{n}}.
- The warehouse is originally empty and is required to be empty at the end of the last period.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"holding_cost": holding_cost,
	"price", [price_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"cost": [cost_{n} for n in 1,...,N]
}


OBJECTIVE: Determine the amount of buying and selling in each period to maximize the profit over the months

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{buyquantity} represents the amount of buying in each period
- \var{sellquantity} represents the amount of selling in each period
- \var{stock} represents the stock in each period, excluding the intial stock

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"buyquantity": [buyquantity_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"sellquantity": [sellquantity_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"stock": [stock_{n} for n in 1,...,N]
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this warehouse operation problem, let's define a linear programming model. We will use the following variables:

- \( x_n \): the amount of buying in period \( n \)
- \( y_n \): the amount of selling in period \( n \)
- \( s_n \): the stock level at the end of period \( n \)

The objective is to maximize the total profit over \( N \) periods. The profit for each period is given by the revenue from selling minus the cost of buying and the holding cost of the stock. 

######### Problem Constraints
1. **Capacity Constraint**: The stock at any period should not exceed the warehouse capacity.
   \[
   0 \leq s_n \leq \text{capacity}
   \]
2. **Flow Balance Constraint**: The stock at the end of each period is the stock from the previous period plus purchases minus sales.
   \[
   s_{n-1} + x_n - y_n = s_n
   \]
3. **Initial and Final Stock Conditions**: The warehouse starts and ends empty.
   \[
   s_0 = 0, \quad s_N = 0
   \]

######### Objective Function
Maximize the total profit over all periods \( N \):
\[
\text{Maximize } \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( \text{price}_n \cdot y_n - \text{cost}_n \cdot x_n - \text{holding\_cost} \cdot s_n \right)
\]

Here is the linear programming model in LaTeX:

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Warehouse Operation}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_n \): buy quantity in period \( n \)
    \item \( y_n \): sell quantity in period \( n \)
    \item \( s_n \): stock level at the end of period \( n \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Maximize the total profit:
\[
\max \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( \text{price}_n \cdot y_n - \text{cost}_n \cdot x_n - \text{holding\_cost} \cdot s_n \right)
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{align*}
    & \text{Capacity constraint:} \\
    & 0 \leq s_n \leq \text{capacity}, \quad \forall n = 1, \ldots, N \\
    \\
    & \text{Flow balance constraint:} \\
    & s_{n-1} + x_n - y_n = s_n, \quad \forall n = 1, \ldots, N \\
    \\
    & \text{Initial and final stock conditions:} \\
    & s_0 = 0 \\
    & s_N = 0
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Remarks}
- The warehouse must start and end empty.
- Stock levels and buying/selling quantities are non-negative.

\end{document}
```

This model will help determine the optimal buying and selling quantities in each period to maximize the profit, while adhering to the warehouse capacity and other given constraints.
