PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- An investor has a portfolio of \var{N} different stocks.
- He has bought \var{bought_i} shares of stock \var{i} at price \var{buyPrice_i}. 
- The current price of one share of stock \var{i} is \var{currentPrice_i}.
- The investor expects that the price of one share of stock \var{i} in one year will be \var{futurePrice_i}.
- If he sells shares, the investor pays transaction costs at the rate of \var{transactionRate} % of the amount transacted.
- In addition, the investor pays taxes at the rate of \var{taxRate} % on capital gains (i.e., the difference between the amount received from selling shares and the amount paid to buy them).
- Both transaction costs and taxes are numbers between 0 and 100.
- The investor wants to raise an amount of money \var{K} net of capital gains and transaction costs.
- You can assume that the investor can sell floating point numbers of shares.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "bought": [bought_i, for i in 1, ..., N],
    "buyPrice": [buyPrice_i, for i in 1, ..., N],
    "currentPrice": [currentPrice_i, for i in 1, ..., N],
    "futurePrice": [futurePrice_i, for i in 1, ..., N],
    "transactionRate": transactionRate,
    "taxRate": taxRate,
    "K": K
}

OBJECTIVE: We want to know how many shares the investor needs to sell in order to raise the needed money, net of capital gains and transaction costs, while maximizing the expected value of his portfolio next year.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{sell_i} is the number of shares of stock \var{i} that the investor should sell.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "sell": [sell_i, for i in 1, ..., N],
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem, we need to set up a linear programming problem that maximizes the expected value of the portfolio while ensuring that the net amount raised after selling the shares is at least \( K \). Here's how you can structure the problem in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

\subsection*{Variables}
\begin{align*}
    & \text{Let } \text{sell}_i \text{ be the number of shares of stock } i \text{ to sell for } i = 1, \dots, N.
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Maximize the expected value of the portfolio next year:
\begin{align*}
    \max \sum_{i=1}^{N} (bought_i - \text{sell}_i) \times \text{futurePrice}_i
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{align*}
    & \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[ \text{sell}_i \times \text{currentPrice}_i \times \left(1 - \frac{\text{transactionRate}}{100}\right) - \max\left(0, (\text{sell}_i \times \text{currentPrice}_i - \text{sell}_i \times \text{buyPrice}_i) \times \frac{\text{taxRate}}{100}\right) \right] \geq K \\
    & 0 \leq \text{sell}_i \leq \text{bought}_i \quad \text{for each } i.
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Explanation}
- The objective function aims to maximize the expected value of the investor's portfolio next year, considering the stocks remaining after selling some.
- The first constraint ensures that the net amount of money raised by selling the shares (after accounting for transaction costs and capital gains taxes) is at least \( K \).
- The second set of constraints ensures that the number of shares sold does not exceed the number of shares the investor has bought for each stock.

\end{document}
```

The constraint involves calculating the net proceeds from selling the shares, taking into account both transaction costs and taxes on any capital gains. The decision variables are the number of shares to sell for each stock, which need to be optimally determined by solving this linear program.
