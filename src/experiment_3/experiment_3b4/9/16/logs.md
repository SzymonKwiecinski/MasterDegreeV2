PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- A manager of an oil refinery has \var{allocated_i} million barrels of crude oil type \var{i} allocated for production during the coming month. 
- These resources can be used to make \var{P} different products. product \var{p} sells for $ \var{price_p} per barrel.
- There are \var{L} production processes. Process \var{l} uses \var{input_l_i} barrels of each crude \var{i}, and produces \var{output_l_p} barrels of each product \var{p}. 
- Process \var{l} has a cost of \var{cost_l} per barrel of product produced.
- All \var{input_l_i} quantities and \var{output_l_p} quanitites are in barrels. 
- There are no separate cost items for the cost of the crudes, as they have already been allocated.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "allocated": [allocated_i for i in 1, ..., O],
    "price": [price_p for p in 1, ..., P],
    "input": [[input_l_i for i in 1, ..., O] for l in 1, ..., L],
    "output": [[output_l_p for p in 1, ..., P] for l in 1, ..., L],
    "cost": [cost_l for l in 1, ..., L]
}

OBJECTIVE: We want to know how many times should we execute each process to maximize the revenue for the next month (you can assume that the number of times that each process is executed is a floating point number)

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{revenue} is the total revenue for the month.
- \var{execute_l} is the number of times that process \var{l} should be executed.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "revenue": revenue,
    "execute": [execute_l for l in 1, ..., L]
}

To solve this problem using Linear Programming, we need to create a mathematical model that captures the essence of the problem. The objective is to maximize the revenue from selling products while considering the costs of executing each process and the constraints on crude oil allocations. Let's define the decision variables and the constraints:

**Decision Variables:**
- Let \( x_l \) be the number of times the process \( l \) is executed for \( l = 1, 2, \ldots, L \).

**Objective Function:**
- We aim to maximize the total revenue. The revenue from selling the products minus the cost of the processes gives the profit. The total revenue is given by:

\[
\text{Revenue} = \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{p=1}^{P} (\text{output}_{l,p} \cdot \text{price}_p \cdot x_l) - \sum_{l=1}^{L} (\text{cost}_l \cdot x_l)
\]

**Constraints:**
1. Supply Constraints: The amount of crude oil used in each process should not exceed the allocated amount:

\[
\sum_{l=1}^{L} (\text{input}_{l,i} \cdot x_l) \leq \text{allocated}_i \quad \text{for each crude type } i
\]

2. Non-negativity Constraints: The decision variables should be non-negative:

\[
x_l \geq 0 \quad \text{for each process } l
\]

Here is the complete mathematical model in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Mathematical Model for Maximizing Revenue of an Oil Refinery}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{align*}
x_l & : \text{Number of times process } l \text{ is executed for } l = 1, 2, \ldots, L.
\end{align*}

\textbf{Objective Function:}
\begin{align*}
\text{Maximize } & \quad \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{p=1}^{P} (\text{output}_{l,p} \times \text{price}_p \times x_l) - \sum_{l=1}^{L} (\text{cost}_l \times x_l)
\end{align*}

\textbf{Constraints:}
\begin{align*}
\sum_{l=1}^{L} (\text{input}_{l,i} \times x_l) & \leq \text{allocated}_i, \quad \text{for each crude type } i = 1, 2, \ldots, O \\
x_l & \geq 0, \quad \text{for each process } l = 1, 2, \ldots, L
\end{align*}

\end{document}
```

This model will help determine the optimal number of times each process should be executed to maximize the total revenue, subject to the resource constraints.
