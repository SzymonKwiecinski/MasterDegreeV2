<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"benefit": [[benefit_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...,K],
	"communication": [[communication_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
	"cost": [[cost_{l, m} for m in 1,...,L] for l in 1,...,L],
}


OBJECTIVE: Where should each department be located so as to minimize overall yearly cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{islocated_{k, l}} represents whether department \var{k} is relocated at city \var{l}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "islocated": [[islocated_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...K],

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To formulate this problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) model, we define the decision variables, objective function, and constraints based on the problem description and input format. The goal is to minimize the overall yearly cost of relocating departments while considering relocation benefits and communication costs. Below is the mathematical model in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Model}

\subsection*{Sets and Indices}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( K \) be the set of departments, indexed by \( k \).
    \item Let \( L \) be the set of locations (cities), indexed by \( l \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{benefit}_{k, l} \): Benefit for department \( k \) being relocated to city \( l \) (in thousands of pounds).
    \item \( \text{communication}_{k, j} \): Quantity of communication between department \( k \) and department \( j \).
    \item \( \text{cost}_{l, m} \): Unit cost of communication between city \( l \) and city \( m \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{islocated}_{k, l} \in \{0, 1\} \): Binary variable indicating if department \( k \) is relocated to city \( l \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the overall yearly cost, which is the negative of total benefits plus total communication costs:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize } & -\sum_{k \in K} \sum_{l \in L} \text{benefit}_{k, l} \cdot \text{islocated}_{k, l} \\
& + \sum_{k \in K} \sum_{j \in K} \sum_{l \in L} \sum_{m \in L} \text{communication}_{k, j} \cdot \text{cost}_{l, m} \cdot \text{islocated}_{k, l} \cdot \text{islocated}_{j, m}
\end{align*}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each department must be located in exactly one city:
    \[
    \sum_{l \in L} \text{islocated}_{k, l} = 1, \quad \forall k \in K
    \]
    
    \item No more than three departments can be located in any single city:
    \[
    \sum_{k \in K} \text{islocated}_{k, l} \leq 3, \quad \forall l \in L
    \]
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

This model captures the constraints that each department must be in one location and no location can host more than three departments. The objective function aims to minimize the net cost by considering both the benefits of relocation and the communication costs between locations.
