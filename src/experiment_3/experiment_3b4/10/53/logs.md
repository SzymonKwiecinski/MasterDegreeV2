PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }

\section*{Transportation Problem as a Linear Program}

We are tasked with modeling the transportation of soybeans from terminal cities to destination cities via port cities, minimizing the transportation costs.

\subsection*{Sets and Indices}
- Let \( \mathcal{K} \) be the set of terminal cities.
- Let \( \mathcal{L} \) be the set of destination cities.
- Let \( \mathcal{P} \) be the set of port cities.
- Let \( \mathcal{A} \subseteq (\mathcal{K} \cup \mathcal{P}) \times (\mathcal{P} \cup \mathcal{L}) \) be the set of all routes.

\subsection*{Parameters}
- \( C_{i,j} \): Cost per metric ton to transport soybeans along route \((i, j) \).
- \( \text{supply}_k \): Supply of soybeans at terminal city \( k \).
- \( \text{demand}_l \): Demand for soybeans at destination city \( l \).

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
- \( x_{i,j} \): Amount of soybeans transported from city \( i \) to city \( j \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total cost:
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{A}} C_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
1. Supply Constraints for each terminal city \( k \):
\[
\sum_{(k,j) \in \mathcal{A}} x_{k,j} \leq \text{supply}_k \quad \forall k \in \mathcal{K}
\]

2. Demand Constraints for each destination city \( l \):
\[
\sum_{(i,l) \in \mathcal{A}} x_{i,l} \geq \text{demand}_l \quad \forall l \in \mathcal{L}
\]

3. Flow Conservation for each port city \( p \):
\[
\sum_{(i,p) \in \mathcal{A}} x_{i,p} = \sum_{(p,j) \in \mathcal{A}} x_{p,j} \quad \forall p \in \mathcal{P}
\]

4. Non-negativity Constraints:
\[
x_{i,j} \geq 0 \quad \forall (i,j) \in \mathcal{A}
\]

#### Data
num_terminals = 3
num_destinations = 4
cost = [[34, 49, 17, 26], [52, 64, 23, 14], [20, 28, 12, 17]]

supply = [150, 100, 100]

#### Indices for terminals, destinations, and ports
terminals = range(num_terminals)
destinations = range(num_destinations)
#### In this example, let's assume ports are labeled the same as terminals for simplicity
ports = range(num_terminals)

#### Create a list of all routes
routes = [(i, j) for i in range(num_terminals) for j in range(num_destinations)]

#### Decision Variables
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("x", (range(num_terminals), range(num_destinations)), lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')

#### Initialize the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Transportation_Problem", pulp.LpMinimize)

#### Objective function
problem += pulp.lpSum([cost[i][j] * x[i][j] for (i, j) in routes])

#### Supply constraints for terminals
for k in terminals:
    problem += pulp.lpSum([x[k][j] for j in destinations]) <= supply[k]

#### Demand constraints for destinations
for l in destinations:
    problem += pulp.lpSum([x[i][l] for i in terminals]) >= demand[l]

#### Flow conservation for ports
#### (In this example, flow conservation is not restrictive as we have no intermediate ports)

#### Solve the problem
problem.solve()

#### Print the objective value
