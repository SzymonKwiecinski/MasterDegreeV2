PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- A hospital wants to make a weekly night shift (12pm-8am) schedule for its nurses. 
- The demand for nurses for the night shift on day \var{j} = 1,...,7 is an integer \var{d_j}. 
- Every nurse works \var{period} days in a row on the night shift, followed by (7 - \var{period}) days off.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "period": period,
    "demand": [d_j for j in 1, ...,7]
}

OBJECTIVE: The goal is to find the minimal number of nurses the hospital needs to hire. 

OUTPUT INFO: 

- for each day \var{j} = 1,...,7, \var{start_j} which shows the number of nurses that start their period on day \var{j}.
- the total number of nurses hired.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "start": [start_j for j in 1, ...,7],
    "total": total
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To formulate this problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, we define:

- \( \text{period} \): Number of consecutive days a nurse works.
- \( d_j \): Demand for the night shift on day \( j \), where \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \).

**Variables:**

- \( \text{start}_j \): Integer variable representing the number of nurses that start their period on day \( j \), for \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \).

**Objective:**

The objective is to minimize the total number of nurses hired.

**Constraints:**

1. The total number of nurses available on any day \( j \) must meet the demand \( d_j \).
2. Nurses work for \( \text{period} \) consecutive days, then have \( 7-\text{period} \) days off.

The total number of nurses available on any given day \( j \) is calculated by adding up all the nurses who started working within the last \( \text{period} \) days.

Here is the mathematical formulation in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{MILP Model for Nurse Scheduling}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{period} \): Number of consecutive days a nurse works.
    \item \( d_j \): Demand for nurses on day \( j \), \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{start}_j \): Number of nurses starting their period on day \( j \), \( j = 1, \ldots, 7 \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total number of nurses hired:
\[
\min \sum_{j=1}^{7} \text{start}_j
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{align*}
\forall j = 1,\ldots,7, \quad \sum_{i=j-\text{period}+1}^{j} \text{start}_i & \geq d_j \\
\text{start}_i & \geq 0 \quad \text{and integer} \quad \forall i = 1,\ldots,7
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Explanation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The constraint ensures that for each day \( j \), the sum of nurses who have started within the last \( \text{period} \) days is at least the demand \( d_j \).
    \item Indices in the constraints are calculated modulo 7 to account for the weekly cycle, i.e., after day 7, the next day is day 1.
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

In this formulation:
- The demand for each day is guaranteed by summing the nurses who have started within the \( \text{period} \) window preceding each day.
- The objective is to minimize the total number of nurses hired, which corresponds to the sum of \( \text{start}_j \) over all days.
