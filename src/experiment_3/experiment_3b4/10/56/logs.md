PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} × \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we can formulate it as a Linear Programming (LP) problem. We aim to minimize the total travel time of the delivery person walking from the intersection of the 1st Avenue and 1st Street to the intersection of the Wth Avenue and Nth Street. The journey involves walking either north or west on an N-1 × W-1 grid. 

We will define binary decision variables to determine whether the delivery person moves north or west from each intersection, and then use these variables to calculate the total travel time.

Let's denote:
- \( x_{n,w}^N \): A binary variable which is 1 if the delivery person moves north from the intersection of the w-th Avenue and n-th Street, and 0 otherwise.
- \( x_{n,w}^W \): A binary variable which is 1 if the delivery person moves west from the intersection of the w-th Avenue and n-th Street, and 0 otherwise.

The LP formulation is as follows:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Objective:}
Minimize the total travel time:
\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W} \text{north\_time}_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w}^N + \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} \text{west\_time}_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w}^W
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}
- Start at (1,1):
\[
x_{1,1}^W + x_{1,1}^N = 1
\]

- Flow conservation:
\[
x_{n,w}^W + x_{n+1,w}^N = x_{n,w+1}^W + x_{n,w}^N, \quad \forall n \in [1, N-1], \forall w \in [1, W-1]
\]

- End at (N,W):
\[
x_{N,W-1}^W + x_{N-1, W}^N = 1
\]

- Binary constraints:
\[
x_{n,w}^N, x_{n,w}^W \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall n, w.
\]

\end{document}
```

In this linear program:
- The objective function sums up the travel times across all possible north and west movements, each weighted by the corresponding binary variable.
- The constraints ensure that each junction either proceeds north or west, and that the flow of movement is conserved between intersections.
- The binary constraint ensures a movement decision is made at each intersection.
