PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements in future years. 
- Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. 
- In addition to this, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, which will reduce the need for workers in all categories.
- The estimated manpower requirements for manpower \var{k} in year \var{i} is \var{requirement_{k, i}}.
- The current number of manpower \var{k} is \var{strength_{k}}.
- The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to recruitment, retraining, redundancy and short-time working in the next years.
- There is a natural wastage of labour. 
- A fairly large number of workers leave during their first year. After this, the rate of leaving is much smaller. 
- Taking this into account, the wastage rates of manpower \var{k} with less than one year's service is \var{lessonewaste_{k}}.
- The wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with more than one year's service is \var{moreonewaste_{k}}.
- There has been no recent recruitment and all the workers in the current labour force have been employed for more than one year.
- It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. 
- In any one year, the maximum number that can be recruited in manpower \var{k} is \var{recruit_{k}}.
- The redundancy payment to manpower \var{k} is \var{costredundancy_{k}}.
- It is possible to employ up to \var{num_overman} more workers over the whole company than are needed, but the extra costs per employee per year is \var{costoverman_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- Up to \var{num_shortwork} workers in each category of skill can be put on short-time working. 
- The cost of this (per employee per year) is \var{costshort_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of half a full-time employee.

## START MESSAGE 1 
### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem, we need to define decision variables, objective function and constraints that reflect the given problem scenario. Let's use the provided information to set up the linear programming model.

######### Decision Variables
- \( x_{k,i} \): Number of manpower of type \( k \) recruited in year \( i \).
- \( y_{k,i} \): Number of manpower of type \( k \) doing overmanning in year \( i \).
- \( z_{k,i} \): Number of manpower of type \( k \) doing short-time working in year \( i \).
- \( r_{k,i} \): Number of manpower of type \( k \) made redundant in year \( i \).

######### Objective Function
The objective is to minimize the redundancy payments:
\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{i=1}^{I} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{costredundancy}_k \cdot r_{k,i}
\]

######### Constraints
1. **Balance of Manpower:**
   For each manpower type \( k \) and each year \( i \):
   \begin{align*}
   \text{strength}_{k} & + x_{k,i} - r_{k,i} - \text{lessonewaste}_k \cdot x_{k,i} - \text{moreonewaste}_k \cdot (\text{strength}_{k} + x_{k,i-1} - r_{k,i-1}) + y_{k,i} + 0.5 \cdot z_{k,i} \\
   & = \text{requirement}_{k,i}
   \end{align*}

2. **Recruitment Limit:**
   \[
   0 \leq x_{k,i} \leq \text{recruit}_{k}
   \]

3. **Overmanning Limit:**
   \[
   \sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_overman}
   \]

4. **Short-time working Limit:**
   \[
   0 \leq z_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_shortwork}
   \]

5. **Non-negativity:**
   \[
   x_{k,i}, y_{k,i}, z_{k,i}, r_{k,i} \geq 0
   \]

Now, let's put this into a LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

\paragraph{Objective:}
Minimize redundancy costs:
\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{i=1}^{I} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{costredundancy}_k \times r_{k,i}

   & + y_{k,i} + 0.5 \times z_{k,i} = \text{requirement}_{k,i}, \\
   & \forall k = 1, \ldots, K, \; \forall i = 1, \ldots, I
   \end{align*}

2. **Recruitment Limit:**
   \[
   0 \leq x_{k,i} \leq \text{recruit}_{k}, \; \forall k = 1, \ldots, K, \; \forall i = 1, \ldots, I
   \]

3. **Overmanning Limit:**
   \[
   \sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_overman}, \; \forall i = 1, \ldots, I
   \]

4. **Short-time working Limit:**
   \[
   0 \leq z_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_shortwork}, \; \forall k = 1, \ldots, K, \; \forall i = 1, \ldots, I
   \]

5. **Non-negativity:**
   \[
   x_{k,i}, y_{k,i}, z_{k,i}, r_{k,i} \geq 0, \; \forall k = 1, \ldots, K, \; \forall i = 1, \ldots, I
