PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

To solve this problem, we will create a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. The objective is to minimize the number of floppy disks needed to store all files given their sizes and the capacity of each disk. 

We have the following decision variables:

1. \( x_{ij} \): A binary variable that equals 1 if file \( j \) is stored on disk \( i \), and 0 otherwise.
2. \( y_i \): A binary variable that equals 1 if disk \( i \) is used, and 0 otherwise.

######### MILP Model

**Objective:** Minimize the number of disks used.
\[ \min \sum_{i=1}^M y_i \]

**Constraints:**

1. Each file must be stored on exactly one disk.
\[ \sum_{i=1}^M x_{ij} = 1 \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, N \]

2. The total size of files on any disk must not exceed its capacity. 
\[ \sum_{j=1}^N \text{size}_j \times x_{ij} \leq \text{capacity} \times y_i \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M \]

3. \( x_{ij} \) must be binary.
\[ x_{ij} \in \{0,1\} \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M, \; \forall j = 1, \ldots, N \]

4. \( y_i \) must be binary.
\[ y_i \in \{0,1\} \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M \]

Where \( M = N \), the maximum number of disks needed (one file per disk).

Here is the LaTeX representation of the mathematical model:

\begin{document}

\textbf{MILP Model:}

\textbf{Objective:}
\[
\min \sum_{i=1}^M y_i
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}
\[
\sum_{i=1}^M x_{ij} = 1 \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, N
\]

\[
\sum_{j=1}^N \text{size}_j \times x_{ij} \leq \text{capacity} \times y_i \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M
\]

\[
x_{ij} \in \{0,1\} \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M, \; \forall j = 1, \ldots, N
\]

\[
y_i \in \{0,1\} \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M
\]

\end{document}
```

This model ensures that we distribute the files across the minimum number of disks while respecting the capacity constraint of each disk. You can solve this problem using any MILP solver like CPLEX, Gurobi, or any other software capable of handling integer optimization. The output will provide the number of disks used and on which disk each file is placed.
