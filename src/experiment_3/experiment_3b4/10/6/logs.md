PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT:

    "v_0": v_0,

}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the total fuel \sum_{t=0}^{\var{T}-1} |\var{a_t}| spent subject to the preceding constraints.

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}

- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}

To solve the given problem, we must formulate a linear programming model that aims to minimize the total fuel consumption, represented by the absolute value of acceleration, while considering the constraints given by the discrete-time motion equations and the initial and final conditions.

Below is the LaTeX representation of the LP model:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Rocket Trajectory Optimization}

\subsection*{Objective:}
Minimize the total fuel consumption:
\[
\min \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Constraints:}

1. Initial conditions:
   \[
   x_0 = \text{given}, \quad v_0 = \text{given}
   \]

2. Motion equations for \( t = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, T-1 \):
   \[
   x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t 
   \]
   \[
   v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t
   \]

3. Final conditions:
   \[
   x_T = \text{given}, \quad v_T = \text{given}
   \]

\subsection*{Variables:}
- \( x_t \): Position of the rocket at time \( t \)
- \( v_t \): Velocity of the rocket at time \( t \)
- \( a_t \): Acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \)

\subsection*{Note:}
The absolute value constraint on the acceleration \(|a_t|\) can be linearized by introducing auxiliary variables and constraints:
Let \( a_t^+ \geq 0 \) and \( a_t^- \geq 0 \).

Then, express \( a_t = a_t^+ - a_t^- \) and add the constraint:
\[
a_t^+ + a_t^- = |a_t|
\]

The new objective becomes:
\[
\min \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} (a_t^+ + a_t^-)
\]

The LP model now includes these auxiliary variables for each time step to handle the absolute value constraint linearly.

\end{document}
```

This model outlines the constraints and objective function necessary for minimizing the total fuel consumption subject to the given motion dynamics and initial/final conditions. The transformation of the absolute value into linear constraints using auxiliary variables allows the problem to be handled by standard linear programming solvers.
