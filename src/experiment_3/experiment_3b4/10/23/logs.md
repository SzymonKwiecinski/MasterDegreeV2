PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements in future years. 
- Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. 
- In addition to this, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, which will reduce the need for workers in all categories.
- The estimated manpower requirements for manpower \var{k} in year \var{i} is \var{requirement_{k, i}}.
- The current strength of manpower \var{k} is \var{strength_{k}}.
- The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to recruitment, retraining, redundancy and short-time working in the next years.
- There is a natural wastage of labour. 
- A fairly large number of workers leave during their first year. After this, the rate is much smaller. 
- Taking this into account, the wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with less than one year's service is \var{lessonewaste_{k}}.
- The wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with more than one year's service is \var{moreonewaste_{k}}.
- There has been no recent recruitment and all workers in the current labour force have been employed for more than one year.
- It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. 
- In any one year, the numbers that can be recruited in manpower \var{k} is \var{recruit_{k}}.
- The redundancy payment to manpower \var{k} is \var{costredundancy_{k}}.
- It is possible to employ up to \var{num_overman} more workers over the whole company than are needed, but the extra costs per employee per year is \var{costoverman_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- Up to \var{num_shortwork} workers in each category of skill can be put on short-time working. 
- The cost of this (per employee per year) is \var{costshort_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of half a full-time employee.

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we will formulate a linear programming model that minimizes the costs associated with recruitment, redundancy, overmanning, short-time working, and wastage. We will define decision variables for recruitment, redundancy, overmanning, and short-time working for each manpower category \(k\) and each year \(i\).
