\section*{Mathematical Model}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let \( x_{k,l} \) be a binary variable representing whether department \( k \) is located in city \( l \):
\[
x_{k,l} = 
\begin{cases} 
1, & \text{if department } k \text{ is located in city } l \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\subsection*{Objective Function}
The objective is to minimize the overall yearly cost, which includes both the benefits of relocation and communication costs. The objective function can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad 
\sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} x_{k,l} \cdot \text{benefit}_{k,l} 
+ \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{j=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{m=1}^{L} x_{k,l} \cdot x_{j,m} \cdot \text{communication}_{k,j} \cdot \text{cost}_{l,m}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. **Each department is located in exactly one city:**
   \[
   \sum_{l=1}^{L} x_{k,l} = 1, \quad \forall k \in \{1, 2, \ldots, K\}
   \]

2. **No city hosts more than three departments:**
   \[
   \sum_{k=1}^{K} x_{k,l} \leq 3, \quad \forall l \in \{1, 2, \ldots, L\}
   \]

3. **Binary constraint on decision variables:**
   \[
   x_{k,l} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall k \in \{1, 2, \ldots, K\}, \forall l \in \{1, 2, \ldots, L\}
   \]

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{benefit}_{k,l} \): Benefits for department \( k \) from relocation at city \( l \).
    \item \( \text{communication}_{k,j} \): Quantity of communication between department \( k \) and department \( j \).
    \item \( \text{cost}_{l,m} \): Unit cost of communication between city \( l \) and city \( m \).
\end{itemize}
