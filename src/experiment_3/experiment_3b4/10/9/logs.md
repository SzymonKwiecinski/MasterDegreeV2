PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a road divided into \var{N} segments that is illuminated by \var{M} lamps.
- Let \var{power_j} be the power of the \var{j}-th lamp. The illumination \var{ill_i} of the \var{i}-th segment is assumed to be \sum_{j=1}^{\var{M}} \var{coeff_{i,j}} \var{power_j}, where \var{coeff_{i,j}} are known coefficients.
- Let \var{desired_i} be the desired illumination of road \var{i}. 
- We are interested in choosing the lamp powers \var{power_j} so that the illuminations {ill_i} are close to the desired illuminations {desired_i}. 

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "coeff": [[coeff_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., M] for i in 1, ..., N],
    "desired": [desired_i for i in 1, ..., N]
}

OBJECTIVE: Find the lamp powers \var{power_j} that minimize the absolute error between the illuminations {ill_i} and the desired illuminations {desired_i}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{power_j} is the optimal power of the \var{j}-th lamp.
- \var{error} is the absolute error between the illuminations {ill_i} and the desired illuminations {desired_i}.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "power": [power_j for j in 1, ..., M]
    "error": error
}

To solve this problem, we need to minimize the absolute error between the actual illumination and the desired illumination for each segment. This can be formulated as a linear programming problem with the objective of minimizing the sum of absolute errors.

######### Problem Formulation

Given:
- \(\text{coeff}_{i,j}\): Coefficients for the contribution of lamp \(j\) to segment \(i\).
- \(\text{desired}_i\): Desired illumination for segment \(i\).

Variables:
- \(\text{power}_j\): Power of lamp \(j\).
- \(\text{error}_i\): Absolute error for segment \(i\).

Objective:
Minimize:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{error}_i
\]

Subject to:
\[
-\text{error}_i \leq \sum_{j=1}^{M} \text{coeff}_{i,j} \cdot \text{power}_j - \text{desired}_i \leq \text{error}_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
\]

The constraints ensure that the absolute value of the error is captured correctly.

Here is the corresponding mathematical model implemented in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\textbf{Problem Formulation:}

Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Coefficients matrix: \(\text{coeff} = [\text{coeff}_{i,j}]\) for \(i = 1, \ldots, N\) and \(j = 1, \ldots, M\)
    \item Desired illumination: \(\text{desired} = [\text{desired}_i]\) for \(i = 1, \ldots, N\)
\end{itemize}

Variables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lamp power: \(\text{power} = [\text{power}_j]\) for \(j = 1, \ldots, M\)
    \item Error: \(\text{error} = [\text{error}_i]\) for \(i = 1, \ldots, N\)
\end{itemize}

Objective:
\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{error}_i
\]

Subject to:
\[
-\text{error}_i \leq \sum_{j=1}^{M} \text{coeff}_{i,j} \cdot \text{power}_j - \text{desired}_i \leq \text{error}_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
\]

\end{document}
```

This LP can be solved using an optimization solver to find the optimal lamp powers \( \text{power}_j \) and the minimal sum of absolute errors.
