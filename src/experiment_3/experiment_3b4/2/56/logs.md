PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To tackle this problem, we need to create an LP model that minimizes the total travel time from the starting point to the destination by selecting the optimal paths on the grid. Our decision variables will represent whether the delivery person chooses to move in a particular direction (north or west) at any intersection.

Here is the mathematical model formulated in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Model for Delivery Route Optimization}

\textbf{Sets and Indices:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N$: Total number of streets (rows).
    \item $W$: Total number of avenues (columns).
    \item $n$: Index for streets, $n = 1, 2, \ldots, N$.
    \item $w$: Index for avenues, $w = 1, 2, \ldots, W$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\text{west\_time}_{n,w}$: Time to move west from $(n, w)$ to $(n, w+1)$.
    \item $\text{north\_time}_{n,w}$: Time to move north from $(n, w)$ to $(n+1, w)$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{n,w}^{\text{west}}$: Binary variable; 1 if the path moves west from $(n, w)$, 0 otherwise.
    \item $x_{n,w}^{\text{north}}$: Binary variable; 1 if the path moves north from $(n, w)$, 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective Function:}
\[
\min \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} \text{west\_time}_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w}^{\text{west}} + 
    \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W} \text{north\_time}_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w}^{\text{north}}
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}
\begin{align}
    & x_{1,1}^{\text{west}} + x_{1,1}^{\text{north}} = 1 & \text{(Start at the first intersection)} \\
    & x_{N,W-1}^{\text{west}} = 1 & \text{(Ensure the endpoint is reached by moving west)} \\
    & \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} x_{n,w}^{\text{west}} + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} x_{n,w}^{\text{north}} = 1 & \forall n, w \, \text{(Flow conservation)} \\
    & x_{n,w}^{\text{west}}, x_{n,w}^{\text{north}} \in \{0, 1\} & \forall n, w
\end{align}

This linear programming model sets up the conditions for navigating the grid optimally, ensuring that the delivery person only moves in permissible directions and does so to minimize the total travel time.

\end{document}
```

This model will provide the paths that result in the minimum total travel time, adhering to the constraints that the delivery person can only move north or west. The constraints ensure that flow conservation is maintained at each intersection, meaning that the delivery person enters and exits each point properly and reaches the destination point.
