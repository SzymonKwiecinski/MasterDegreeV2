PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- The town has \var{S} different shifts for the police officers during the day.
- During each shift \var{s}, the town requires \var{officers_needed_{s}} police officers on duty.
- Each police officer works for two consecutive shifts.
- The cost for the town when starting a shift at \var{s} is \var{shift_cost_{s}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "officers_needed": [officers_needed_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "shift_costs": [shift_cost_{s} for s in 1, ..., S]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many officers should the town assign to each shift in order to minimize the total cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- The number of officers assigned to each shift \var{officers_assigned_{s}}.
- \var{total_cost} indicates the total cost for the town.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "officers_assigned": [officers_assigned_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

The given problem can be formulated as a Linear Programming (LP) problem. The objective is to minimize the total cost of assigning police officers to shifts while meeting the required number of officers on duty for each shift. 

To achieve this, we define the decision variables as follows:
- Let \( x_s \) be the number of officers starting their shift at shift \( s \).

The constraints are based on the requirement that the number of officers on duty during each shift \( s \) must meet or exceed the required number \( \text{{officers\_needed}}_s \).

The objective function aims to minimize the total cost of assigning officers, which is the sum of the cost for each shift multiplied by the number of officers starting at that shift.

Here is the mathematical model formulated using LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Objective:}
Minimize the total cost:
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{s=1}^{S} \text{shift\_cost}_s \cdot x_s
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}
\begin{align*}
x_s + x_{s-1} & \geq \text{officers\_needed}_s \quad \text{for } s = 1, 2, ..., S \\
x_s & \geq 0 \quad \text{for } s = 1, 2, ..., S
\end{align*}

\textbf{Where:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_s \) is the number of officers starting at shift \( s \).
    \item \text{shift\_cost}_s is the cost associated with starting a shift at \( s \).
    \item \text{officers\_needed}_s is the number of officers needed at shift \( s \).
    \item \( S \) is the total number of shifts in the day.
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

This formulation ensures that the number of officers on duty is always sufficient while minimizing the cost associated with their assignment.
