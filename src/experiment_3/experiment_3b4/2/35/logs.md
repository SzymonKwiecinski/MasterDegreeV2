PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Consider the problem of operating a warehouse, by buying and selling the stock of a certain commodity, in order to maximize profit over a certain length of time, say several periods.
- The warehouse has a fixed capacity \var{capacity}, and there is a cost \var{holding_cost} per unit for holding stock for one period.
- The selling price, \var{price_{n}}$, of the commodity is known to fluctuate over a number of time periods. 
- In any period \var{n} the price holding for purchase is \var{cost_{n}}.
- The warehouse is originally empty and is required to be empty at the end of the last period.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"holding_cost": holding_cost,
	"price", [price_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"cost": [cost_{n} for n in 1,...,N]
}


OBJECTIVE: Determine the amount of buying and selling in each period to maximize the profit over the months

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{buyquantity} represents the amount of buying in each period
- \var{sellquantity} represents the amount of selling in each period
- \var{stock} represents the stock in each period, excluding the intial stock

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"buyquantity": [buyquantity_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"sellquantity": [sellquantity_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"stock": [stock_{n} for n in 1,...,N]
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve the problem of maximizing the profit over several periods for the warehouse management, we will formulate a linear programming model. The goal is to determine the optimal amount of buying and selling of the commodity in each period while considering the warehouse capacity and holding cost.

Below is the mathematical formulation of the problem in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Warehouse Management}

\textbf{Objective:} Maximize the total profit over $N$ periods.

Let:
\begin{align*}
  \text{capacity} &= \text{Warehouse capacity} \\
  \text{holding\_cost} &= \text{Cost per unit for holding stock for one period} \\
  \text{price}_n &= \text{Selling price of commodity in period } n \\
  \text{cost}_n &= \text{Purchase cost of commodity in period } n \\
  \text{buyquantity}_n &= \text{Quantity bought in period } n \\
  \text{sellquantity}_n &= \text{Quantity sold in period } n \\
  \text{stock}_n &= \text{Stock level at the end of period } n
\end{align*}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    & \text{Maximize } \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( \text{price}_n \cdot \text{sellquantity}_n - \text{cost}_n \cdot \text{buyquantity}_n - \text{holding\_cost} \cdot \text{stock}_n \right)
  \end{aligned}
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}
\begin{align*}
  \text{stock}_1 &= \text{buyquantity}_1 - \text{sellquantity}_1 \\
  \text{stock}_n &= \text{stock}_{n-1} + \text{buyquantity}_n - \text{sellquantity}_n, \quad n = 2, \ldots, N \\
  \text{stock}_n &\leq \text{capacity}, \quad n = 1, \ldots, N \\
  \text{stock}_N &= 0 \\
  \text{buyquantity}_n &\geq 0, \quad n = 1, \ldots, N \\
  \text{sellquantity}_n &\geq 0, \quad n = 1, \ldots, N
\end{align*}

\textbf{Explanation:}
- The objective function maximizes the profit by considering the sales revenue, purchase cost, and holding cost.
- The first constraint calculates the stock level at the end of the first period.
- The second constraint maintains the stock balance for each subsequent period.
- The third constraint ensures that the stock level does not exceed the warehouse capacity.
- The fourth constraint specifies that the stock must be zero at the end of the last period.
- Non-negativity constraints ensure that buying and selling quantities are non-negative.

\end{document}
```

This model calculates the optimal buying and selling quantities and stock levels for each period to maximize profits while respecting constraints such as warehouse capacity and initial/ending stock conditions. Use a Linear Programming solver to find the values of `buyquantity`, `sellquantity`, and `stock` for each period.
