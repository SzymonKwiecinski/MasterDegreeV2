PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- We assume that there are available at the market different foods and that the food \var{k} sells at a price \var{price_{k}} per unit. 
- In addition there are several basic nutritional ingredients and, to achieve a balanced diet, each individual must receive at least \var{demand_{m}} units of nutrient \var{m} per day. 
- Finally, we assume that each unit of food \var{k} contains \var{nutri_{k, m}} units of nutrition \var{m}

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"price": [price_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
	"demand": [demand_{m} for m in 1,...,M],
	"nutrition": [[nutri_{k, m} for m in 1,...,M] for k in 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: We want to minimize the total prices of the foods to purchase.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{quantity} represents the quantity of each food to purchase

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"quantity": [quantity_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem using Linear Programming, we need to formulate an objective function along with constraints using the provided information. Here's how you can represent this problem in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\section*{Diet Optimization Problem}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
We aim to minimize the total cost of purchasing the foods. The objective function can be formulated as:

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{price}_k \cdot \text{quantity}_k
\]

where \(\text{price}_k\) is the price per unit of food \(k\) and \(\text{quantity}_k\) is the quantity of food \(k\) to purchase.

\subsection*{Constraints}
The dietary constraints ensure that each nutritional requirement is met:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{nutri}_{k, m} \cdot \text{quantity}_k \geq \text{demand}_m, \quad \forall m = 1, \ldots, M
\]

where \(\text{nutri}_{k, m}\) is the amount of nutrient \(m\) in food \(k\) and \(\text{demand}_m\) is the required amount of nutrient \(m\).

\subsection*{Non-Negativity Constraints}
All food quantities must be non-negative:

\[
\text{quantity}_k \geq 0, \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
\]

\subsection*{Solution Representation}
The solution will provide the optimal quantity of each food to purchase in order to minimize cost while meeting all nutritional requirements:

\[
\text{Output: } \text{quantity} = [\text{quantity}_1, \ldots, \text{quantity}_K]
\]

\end{document}
```

This LaTeX document captures the essential components of the Linear Programming model to solve the diet optimization problem. You can use this template to compute the quantities of food required by adding numerical data and solving using an LP solver.
