PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO: 
- A hospital wants to make a weekly night shift (12pm-8am) schedule for its nurses. 
- The demand for nurses for the night shift on day \var{j} = 1,...,7 is an integer \var{d_j}. 
- Every nurse works \var{period} days in a row on the night shift, followed by (7 - \var{period}) days off.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "period": period,
    "demand": [d_j for j in 1, ...,7]
}

OBJECTIVE: The goal is to find the minimal number of nurses the hospital needs to hire. 

OUTPUT INFO: 

- for each day \var{j} = 1,...,7, \var{start_j} which shows the number of nurses that start their period on day \var{j}.
- the total number of nurses hired.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "start": [start_j for j in 1, ...,7],
    "total": total
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To address the given problem, we need to formulate it as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. The objective is to determine the minimal number of nurses required such that the hospital's weekly night shift demand is met considering the constraints on the working period for nurses.

Let's define our decision variables and formulate the MILP problem in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\section*{MILP Formulation for Nurse Scheduling}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $period$: Number of consecutive days a nurse works before taking days off.
    \item $d_j$: Demand for nurses on day $j$, for $j = 1, \ldots, 7$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $start_j$: The number of nurses starting their working period on day $j$, for $j = 1, \ldots, 7$.
    \item $total$: Total number of nurses hired.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total number of nurses hired:
\[
\text{Minimize } total = \sum_{j=1}^{7} start_j
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
For each day $j = 1, \ldots, 7$, the constraint ensuring sufficient nurses are working is:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{period-1} start_{(j-k-1) \bmod 7 + 1} \geq d_j
\]
where $(j-k-1) \bmod 7 + 1$ ensures cyclic counting of days from 1 to 7.

\subsection*{Additional Constraints}
All decision variables must take non-negative integer values:
\[
start_j \geq 0, \quad \text{integer, for } j = 1, \ldots, 7
\]

\subsection*{Solution Output}
The solution will provide:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $start = [start_1, \ldots, start_7]$: Number of nurses starting on each day.
    \item $total$: Minimum number of nurses hired.
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

This LaTeX document describes the MILP model needed to solve the problem. It includes the objective function to minimize the total number of nurses and the constraints to ensure that the demand for nurses on each day is met. The cyclic nature of the scheduling period is managed using the modulo operation in the constraints.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total number of nurses hired:
\[
