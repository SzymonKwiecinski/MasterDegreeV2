PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a road divided into \var{N} segments that is illuminated by \var{M} lamps.
- Let \var{power_j} be the power of the \var{j}-th lamp. The illumination \var{ill_i} of the \var{i}-th segment is assumed to be \sum_{j=1}^{\var{M}} \var{coeff_{i,j}} \var{power_j}, where \var{coeff_{i,j}} are known coefficients.
- Let \var{desired_i} be the desired illumination of road \var{i}. 
- We are interested in choosing the lamp powers \var{power_j} so that the illuminations {ill_i} are close to the desired illuminations {desired_i}. 

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "coeff": [[coeff_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., M] for i in 1, ..., N],
    "desired": [desired_i for i in 1, ..., N]
}

OBJECTIVE: Find the lamp powers \var{power_j} that minimize the absolute error between the illuminations {ill_i} and the desired illuminations {desired_i}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{power_j} is the optimal power of the \var{j}-th lamp.
- \var{error} is the absolute error between the illuminations {ill_i} and the desired illuminations {desired_i}.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "power": [power_j for j in 1, ..., M]
    "error": error
}

To address this problem, we can formulate a linear programming model. The goal is to minimize the total absolute error between the actual illumination of each road segment and the desired illumination. We can introduce auxiliary variables to handle the absolute value aspect. Let's define:

- \( \text{power}_j \) as the decision variable for the power of the \( j \)-th lamp.
- \( \text{error}_i^+\) and \( \text{error}_i^- \) as the auxiliary variables representing the positive and negative parts of the deviation from the desired illumination for segment \( i \).

The objective is to minimize the sum of these auxiliary variables, which represent the absolute error. Here's the mathematical formulation:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Objective:}

\[
\min \sum_{i=1}^{N} ( \text{error}_i^+ + \text{error}_i^- )
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}

\[
\sum_{j=1}^{M} \text{coeff}_{i,j} \cdot \text{power}_j - \text{error}_i^+ + \text{error}_i^- = \text{desired}_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
\]

\[
\text{error}_i^+, \text{error}_i^- \geq 0, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
\]

\[
\text{power}_j \geq 0, \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, M
\]

Here, the constraints ensure that the illumination of each segment \(\text{ill}_i\) is equal to the desired illumination \(\text{desired}_i\) adjusted by the positive and negative errors. The non-negativity constraints on \(\text{error}_i^+\) and \(\text{error}_i^-\) ensure that they represent deviations in the positive and negative directions, respectively.

\end{document}
```

This linear programming model can be solved using standard LP solvers, which will yield the optimal powers \(\text{power}_j\) and the minimized absolute error.
