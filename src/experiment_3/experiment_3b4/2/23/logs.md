PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements in future years. 
- Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. 
- In addition to this, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, which will reduce the need for workers in all categories.
- The estimated manpower requirements for manpower \var{k} in year \var{i} is \var{requirement_{k, i}}.
- The current strength of manpower \var{k} is \var{strength_{k}}.
- The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to recruitment, retraining, redundancy and short-time working in the next years.
- There is a natural wastage of labour. 
- A fairly large number of workers leave during their first year. After this, the rate is much smaller. 
- Taking this into account, the wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with less than one year's service is \var{lessonewaste_{k}}.
- The wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with more than one year's service is \var{moreonewaste_{k}}.
- There has been no recent recruitment and all workers in the current labour force have been employed for more than one year.
- It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. 
- In any one year, the numbers that can be recruited in manpower \var{k} is \var{recruit_{k}}.
- The redundancy payment to manpower \var{k} is \var{costredundancy_{k}}.
- It is possible to employ up to \var{num_overman} more workers over the whole company than are needed, but the extra costs per employee per year is \var{costoverman_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- Up to \var{num_shortwork} workers in each category of skill can be put on short-time working. 
- The cost of this (per employee per year) is \var{costshort_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of half a full-time employee.

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
Let's formulate the problem as a Linear Programming (LP) model. We aim to minimize the total cost associated with recruitment, redundancy, overmanning, and short-time work, subject to constraints on manpower requirements, recruitment limits, and wastage.

Define the decision variables:
- \( R_{k,i} \): Number of workers recruited for manpower \( k \) in year \( i \).
- \( O_{k,i} \): Number of overmanning workers for manpower \( k \) in year \( i \).
- \( S_{k,i} \): Number of short-time workers for manpower \( k \) in year \( i \).

Given parameters:
- \( requirement_{k,i} \): Manpower requirement for manpower \( k \) in year \( i \).
- \( strength_k \): Current manpower strength for manpower \( k \).
- \( lessonewaste_k \): Wastage rate for manpower \( k \) with less than one year's service.
- \( moreonewaste_k \): Wastage rate for manpower \( k \) with more than one year's service.
- \( recruit_k \): Maximum number of recruits for manpower \( k \) per year.
- \( costredundancy_k \): Cost of redundancy for manpower \( k \).
- \( num\_overman \): Maximum number of overmanning workers allowed.
- \( costoverman_k \): Cost of overmanning for manpower \( k \).
- \( num\_shortwork \): Maximum number of short-time workers allowed.
- \( costshort_k \): Cost of short-time work for manpower \( k \).

Objective Function:
Minimize total cost:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \sum_{i=1}^{I} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \left( costredundancy_k \times R_{k,i} + costoverman_k \times O_{k,i} + costshort_k \times S_{k,i} \right)
\]

Constraints:
1. Manpower Balance Constraints:
   \[
   strength_k(1 - moreonewaste_k) - \text{previous year wastage for recruited} + R_{k,i} - O_{k,i} - 0.5 \times S_{k,i} = requirement_{k,i}
   \]
   for each manpower \( k \) and year \( i \).

2. Recruitment Limits:
   \[
   0 \leq R_{k,i} \leq recruit_k
   \]
   for each manpower \( k \) and year \( i \).

3. Overmanning Limits:
   \[
   \sum_{k=1}^{K} O_{k,i} \leq num\_overman
   \]
   for each year \( i \).

4. Short-time Work Limits:
   \[
   0 \leq S_{k,i} \leq num\_shortwork
   \]
   for each manpower \( k \) and year \( i \).

5. Non-negativity:
   \[
   R_{k,i}, O_{k,i}, S_{k,i} \geq 0
   \]
   for all \( k \) and \( i \).

Now, let's represent the problem in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

\subsection*{Objective}

Minimize the total cost:
\[
\begin{aligned}
    & \min \sum_{i=1}^{I} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \Big( \text{costredundancy}_k \times R_{k,i} + \text{costoverman}_k \times O_{k,i} + \text{costshort}_k \times S_{k,i} \Big)
\end{aligned}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. Manpower Balance Constraints:
\[
\begin{aligned}
    & \text{strength}_k (1 - \text{moreonewaste}_k) - \text{(previous year wastage for recruited)} + R_{k,i} - O_{k,i} - 0.5 \times S_{k,i} = \text{requirement}_{k,i}, \\
    & \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K,\; i = 1, \ldots, I
\end{aligned}
\]

2. Recruitment Limits:
\[
0 \leq R_{k,i} \leq \text{recruit}_k, \quad \forall k, i
\]

3. Overmanning Limits:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} O_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_overman}, \quad \forall i
\]

4. Short-time Work Limits:
\[
0 \leq S_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_shortwork}, \quad \forall k, i
\]

5. Non-negativity:
\[
R_{k,i}, O_{k,i}, S_{k,i} \geq 0, \quad \forall k, i
\]

\end{document}
``` 

This LP model strategically balances cost minimization with the organizational constraints on recruitment, redundancy, overmanning, and short-time work.
