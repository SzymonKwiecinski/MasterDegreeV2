PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- To operate a cafeteria, the manager must ensure on-call duty based on the statistics on the required staff. 
- In the future days, the number of desired employees on day \var{n} is denoted with \var{num_{n}}.
- Each employee works \var{n_working_days} days in a row and then has \var{n_resting_days} days off.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"num": [num_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"n_working_days": n_working_days,
	"n_resting_days": n_resting_days
}


OBJECTIVE: Calculate the minimum number of employees to hire

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_number} represents the total number of employees to employ
- \var{is_work} represents whether employee is working a rest on each day. Its length is determined by \var{total_number}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"total_number": total_number,
	"is_work": [[is_work_{n, i} for n in 1,...,N] for i in 1,...,total_number]

## START MESSAGE 1 
### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we need to formulate a linear programming model that ensures the cafeteria has the required number of employees on hand each day while minimizing the total number of employees required.

Let's define the decision variables and constraints for the problem:

- Let \( x_i \) be a binary variable that indicates whether employee \( i \) is hired (1 if hired, 0 otherwise).
- Let \( y_{i,n} \) be a binary variable that indicates whether employee \( i \) is working on day \( n \).

The objective is to minimize the total number of employees, which can be expressed as the sum of the \( x_i \) variables.

######### Constraints:

1. **Demand Constraint**: Ensure that the number of employees working on each day \( n \) is at least \( num_n \). This can be expressed as:

   \[
   \sum_{i} y_{i,n} \geq num_n \quad \text{for each day } n
   \]

2. **Work-Rest Schedule Constraint**: Each hired employee can work \( n_{\text{working\_days}} \) days in a row and must rest \( n_{\text{resting\_days}} \) days after that. This constraint is a bit more complex to enforce directly using binary variables, but can be expressed logically in a combined schedule over the period:

   \( y_{i,n} = 1 \) only if \( x_i = 1 \), indicating that only hired employees can work, and they should follow a pattern of working and resting days.

3. **Binary Constraints**: All decision variables \( x_i \) and \( y_{i,n} \) must be binary:

   \[
   x_i \in \{0, 1\}, \quad y_{i,n} \in \{0, 1\}
   \]

######### Model in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}

\begin{document}

\textbf{Objective:}
Minimize the total number of employees:

\[
\min \sum_{i} x_i
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Demand constraints:
    \[
    \sum_{i} y_{i,n} \geq num_n \quad \text{for each day } n
    \]

    \item Work-rest schedule constraints:
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    & y_{i,n} = 1 \text{ if employee } i \text{ works on day } n, \\
    & \text{follows } n_{\text{working\_days}} \text{ work days followed by } n_{\text{resting\_days}} \text{ rest days} 
    \end{aligned}
    \]

    \item Binary constraints:
    \[
    x_i \in \{0, 1\}, \quad y_{i,n} \in \{0, 1\}
    \]
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

This formulated problem can be solved using a mixed-integer linear programming solver to achieve the optimal schedule and number of employees needed. Remember to adjust the constraints to enforce the work-rest schedule correctly in your specific programming or solver environment. The above formulation provides a high-level view and should include additional logic for enforcing the specific cyclic nature of working and resting days.
