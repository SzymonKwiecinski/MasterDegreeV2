PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A mining company is going to continue operating in a certain area for the next years. 
- There are \var{n_mines} mines in this area, but it can operate at most \var{n_maxwork} in any one year. 
- Although a mine may not operate in a certain year, it is still necessary to keep it ‘open’, in the sense that royalties are payable, if it be operated in a future year. 
- Clearly, if a mine is not going to be worked again, it can be permanently closed down and no more royalties need be paid. 
- The yearly royalties payable on each mine kept ‘open’ is \var{royalty_{k}} for mine \var{k}.
- There is an upper limit to the amount of ore, which can be extracted from each mine in a year. 
- The upper limit for mine \var{k} is \var{limit_{k}}.
- The ore from the different mines is of varying quality.
- This quality is measured on a scale so that blending ores together results in a linear combination of the quality measurements, for example, if equal quantities of two ores were combined, the resultant ore would have a quality measurement half way between
that of the ingredient ores. 
- The quality of ore from mine \var{k} is \var{quality_{k}}.
- In each year, it is necessary to combine the total outputs from each mine to produce a blended ore of exactly some stipulated quality.
- In year \var{i}, the required quality is \var{requiredquality_{i}}.
- The final blended ore sells for \var{price} ton each year. 
- Revenue and expenditure for future years must be discounted at a rate of \var{discount} per annum.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "n_mines": n_mines,
    "n_maxwork": n_maxwork,
    "royalty": [royalty_{k} for k in 1,...,K],

OBJECTIVE: To maximize profit, which mines should be operated each year and how much should they produce?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{isoperated} represents whether each mine is operated in each year
- \var{amount} represents the amount of ore produced by each mine in each year

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "isoperated": [[isoperated_{k, i} for i in 1,...,I] for k in 1,...K]

To model this problem, we'll set up a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation to maximize the profit, taking into account the constraints and conditions mentioned. Here is the mathematical formulation in LaTeX:

    \item $K = \{1, 2, \ldots, n_{\text{mines}}\}$: Set of mines.
    \item $I = \{1, 2, \ldots, Y\}$: Set of years.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Parameters:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $n_{\text{maxwork}}$: Maximum number of mines that can be operated in a year.
    \item $\text{royalty}_{k}$: Yearly royalties payable for keeping mine $k$ open.
    \item $\text{limit}_{k}$: Upper limit of ore extraction from mine $k$ per year.
    \item $\text{quality}_{k}$: Quality of ore from mine $k$.
    \item $\text{requiredquality}_{i}$: Required blended ore quality in year $i$.
    \item $\text{price}$: Selling price per ton of final blended ore.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{k,i}$: Amount of ore produced by mine $k$ in year $i$.
    \item $y_{k,i} \in \{0,1\}$: Binary variable indicating whether mine $k$ is operated in year $i$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective Function:}

Maximize the discounted profit:
\[
\max \sum_{i=1}^{Y} \left( \frac{1}{(1+\text{discount})^{i}} \left( \text{price} \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{n_{\text{mines}}} x_{k,i} - \sum_{k=1}^{n_{\text{mines}}} \text{royalty}_{k} \cdot y_{k,i} \right) \right)
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ore quality constraint for each year:
    \[
    \sum_{k=1}^{n_{\text{mines}}} \text{quality}_{k} \cdot x_{k,i} = \text{requiredquality}_{i} \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{n_{\text{mines}}} x_{k,i}, \quad \forall i \in I
    \]

    \item Mine operation and production link:
    \[
    x_{k,i} \leq \text{limit}_{k} \cdot y_{k,i}, \quad \forall k \in K, \forall i \in I
    \]

    \item Maximum number of mines operated in a year:
    \[
    \sum_{k=1}^{n_{\text{mines}}} y_{k,i} \leq n_{\text{maxwork}}, \quad \forall i \in I
    \]

    \item Non-negativity constraint:
    \[
    x_{k,i} \geq 0, \quad \forall k \in K, \forall i \in I
    \]
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

This LaTeX code sets up the constraints and the objective function corresponding to your problem statement. It ensures that the quality constraint is met, the number of operational mines is within limits, and adjusts the revenue based on the discount factor for future years. The model aims to determine the optimal set of mines to operate and the optimal production levels to maximize discounted profit.
