PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is max_t |a_t|. 

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}

To address this problem, we need to formulate a Linear Programming (LP) model. The goal is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is equivalent to minimizing the maximum magnitude of acceleration |a_t| over the given time horizon. Let's define the LP model accordingly:

1. **Decision Variables:**
    - \( x_t \): position of the rocket at time \( t \).
    - \( v_t \): velocity of the rocket at time \( t \).
    - \( a_t \): acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \).
    - \( M \): an auxiliary variable representing the maximum magnitude of acceleration.

2. **Objective Function:**
    - Minimize \( M \).

3. **Constraints:**
    - Discrete-time dynamics:
      \[
      \begin{align*}
      x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \quad \forall t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T-1\} \\
      v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t, \quad \forall t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T-1\}
      \end{align*}
      \]
    - Magnitude of acceleration:
      \[
      |a_t| \leq M, \quad \forall t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T-1\}
      \]
    - Boundary conditions:
      \[
      x_0 = \text{{given initial position}}, \quad v_0 = \text{{given initial velocity}}
      \]
      \[
      x_T = \text{{given target position}}, \quad v_T = \text{{given target velocity}}
      \]

4. **Fuel Consumption:**
    - Total fuel spent is given by the sum of |a_t| over all time steps:
      \[
      \text{fuel\_spent} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
      \]

The complete LP model in LaTeX format is as follows:

\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

\subsection*{Objective}
Minimize \( M \)

\subsection*{Subject to}
\begin{align*}
x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \quad \forall t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T-1\} \\
v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t, \quad \forall t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T-1\} \\
|a_t| &\leq M, \quad \forall t \in \{0, 1, \ldots, T-1\} \\
x_0 &= x_0, \quad v_0 = v_0 \\
x_T &= x_T, \quad v_T = v_T
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Fuel Consumption}
\[
\text{fuel\_spent} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\end{document}
```

This model provides a framework for implementing the solution using LP solvers, which can output the trajectory, velocities, accelerations, and fuel consumption over time.
