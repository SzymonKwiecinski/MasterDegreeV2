PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements in future years. 
- Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. 
- In addition to this, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, which will reduce the need for workers in all categories.
- The estimated manpower requirements for manpower \var{k} in year \var{i} is \var{requirement_{k, i}}.
- The current number of manpower \var{k} is \var{strength_{k}}.
- The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to recruitment, retraining, redundancy and short-time working in the next years.
- There is a natural wastage of labour. 
- A fairly large number of workers leave during their first year. After this, the rate of leaving is much smaller. 
- Taking this into account, the wastage rates of manpower \var{k} with less than one year's service is \var{lessonewaste_{k}}.
- The wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with more than one year's service is \var{moreonewaste_{k}}.
- There has been no recent recruitment and all the workers in the current labour force have been employed for more than one year.
- It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. 
- In any one year, the maximum number that can be recruited in manpower \var{k} is \var{recruit_{k}}.
- The redundancy payment to manpower \var{k} is \var{costredundancy_{k}}.
- It is possible to employ up to \var{num_overman} more workers over the whole company than are needed, but the extra costs per employee per year is \var{costoverman_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- Up to \var{num_shortwork} workers in each category of skill can be put on short-time working. 
- The cost of this (per employee per year) is \var{costshort_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of half a full-time employee.

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model the problem described, we need to set up a linear programming formulation that minimizes redundancy costs while accommodating various constraints related to recruitment, wastage, overmanning, and short-time working. Here's how we can structure this problem:

1. **Decision Variables:**
   - \( \text{recruit}_{k, i} \): Number of new recruits for manpower category \( k \) in year \( i \).
   - \( \text{overmanning}_{k, i} \): Number of overmanning workers for manpower category \( k \) in year \( i \).
   - \( \text{short}_{k, i} \): Number of short-time workers for manpower category \( k \) in year \( i \).

2. **Objective Function:**
   - Minimize the total cost of redundancy over the planning horizon.

3. **Constraints:**
   - Recruitment limitations.
   - Wastage rates for workers with less than and more than one year.
   - Overmanning constraints.
   - Short-time working constraints.
   - Balance constraint to meet manpower requirements.

Below is the complete LATEX representation of this linear programming model:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

\textbf{Objective:}\\
Minimize the total redundancy cost:
\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{i=1}^{I} \text{costredundancy}_k \times \text{redundancy}_{k,i}
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}

1. \textbf{Manpower Balance:}
\[
\text{strength}_k + \sum_{j=1}^{i} \text{recruit}_{k,j} \times (1 - \text{lessonewaste}_k)^{(i-j)_+} \times (1 - \text{moreonewaste}_k)^{i-j-1} - \text{redundancy}_{k,i} + \text{overmanning}_{k,i} + \frac{1}{2} \text{short}_{k,i} \geq \text{requirement}_{k,i}
\]
for all \( k = 1, \ldots, K \), \( i = 1, \ldots, I \).

2. \textbf{Recruitment Constraints:}
\[
0 \leq \text{recruit}_{k,i} \leq \text{recruit}_k
\]
for all \( k = 1, \ldots, K \), \( i = 1, \ldots, I \).

3. \textbf{Overmanning Constraints:}
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{overmanning}_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_overman}
\]
for all \( i = 1, \ldots, I \).

4. \textbf{Short-Time Working Constraints:}
\[
0 \leq \text{short}_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_shortwork}
\]
for all \( k = 1, \ldots, K \), \( i = 1, \ldots, I \).

5. \textbf{Non-negativity Constraints:}
\[
\text{recruit}_{k,i}, \text{redundancy}_{k,i}, \text{overmanning}_{k,i}, \text{short}_{k,i} \geq 0
\]
for all \( k = 1, \ldots, K \), \( i = 1, \ldots, I \).
