PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Suppose that there are \var{N} available currencies, and assume that one unit of currency \var{i} can be exchanged for \var{rate_{i,j}} units of currency \var{j} (Naturally, we assume that \var{rate_{i,j}} > 0).
- There are also certain regulations that impose a limit \var{limit_i} on the total amount of currency \var{i} that can be exchanged (whether to other currencies or from other currencies) on any given day.
- Suppose that we start the day with \var{start_i} units of currency \var{i}
- Provide a linear programming formulation of this problem. Assume that for any sequence \var{i_1}, â€¦ ,\var{i_k} of currencies, we have \var{rate_{i_1,i_2}}, \var{rate_{i_2,i_3}}, ..., \var{rate_{i_{k-1}, i_{k}}, \var{rate_{i_k, i_1}} <= 1, which means that wealth cannot be multiplied by going through a cycle of currencies.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "start": [start_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "limit": [limit_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "rate": [[rate_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., N] for i in 1, ..., N],
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to maximize the number of units of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day, through a sequence of currency transactions.

OUTPUT INFO: 

- The output json file contains a list of transactions, where each transaction is a json object with the following fields:
    - from: the currency that we are exchanging from
    - to: the currency that we are exchanging to
    - amount: the amount of currency that we are exchanging
- The output json file also contains the final amount of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day.

OUTPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": i,
            "to": j,
            "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
    ],
    "final_amount_of_currency_N": final_amount_of_currency_N

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To formulate this problem as a linear programming (LP) problem, we need to define the decision variables, the objective function, and the constraints.

######### Decision Variables:
Let \( x_{i,j} \) be the amount of currency \( i \) that is exchanged for currency \( j \).

######### Objective Function:
We want to maximize the final amount of currency \( N \). The objective function is to maximize:

\[
\text{maximize} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i,N} \cdot \text{rate}_{i,N}
\]

######### Constraints:
1. **Exchange Limit Constraint**: For each currency \( i \), the total amount exchanged (incoming and outgoing) should not exceed \( \text{limit}_i \).
    \[
    \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} \leq \text{limit}_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
    \]

2. **Initial Currency Constraint**: For each currency \( i \), the total amount exchanged cannot exceed the starting amount plus the incoming amounts from other currencies.
    \[
    \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{j,i} \cdot \text{rate}_{j,i} \leq \text{start}_i + \sum_{k=1}^{N} x_{i,k}, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
    \]

3. **Non-negativity Constraint**: The exchange amounts should be non-negative.
    \[
    x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall i, j = 1, \ldots, N
    \]

Now, let's put this into LaTeX format.

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Linear Programming Formulation}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
Let \( x_{i,j} \) be the amount of currency \( i \) exchanged to currency \( j \).

\textbf{Objective Function:}
\[
\text{maximize} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i,N} \cdot \text{rate}_{i,N}
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}
1. Exchange Limit Constraint:
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} \leq \text{limit}_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
\]

2. Initial Currency Constraint:
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{j,i} \cdot \text{rate}_{j,i} \leq \text{start}_i + \sum_{k=1}^{N} x_{i,k}, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, N
\]

3. Non-negativity Constraint:
\[
x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall i, j = 1, \ldots, N
\]

\end{document}
```

This formulation provides a structured way to determine the optimal transactions to maximize the final amount of currency \( N \), adhering to the given constraints and limitations. The output of the LP solution will guide the specific transactions in the desired JSON format.
