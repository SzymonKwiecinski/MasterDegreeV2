<DESCRIPTION>
PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- An economy consists of several industries. 
- Each unit produced by one of the industries (a unit will be taken as £1’s worth of value of production) requires inputs from possibly its own industry as well as other industries. 
- Industry \var{k} requires \var{inputone_{k, j}} input from industy \var{j}.
- Industry \var{k} requires \var{manpowerone_{k}} units of manpower.
- There is a time lag in the economy so that the output in year t + 1 requires an input in year t.
- Output from an industry may also be used to build productive capacity for itself or other industries in future years.
- To give unit increases (capacity for £1’s worth of extra production) in productive capacity of industry \var{k}, \var{j} units of industry \var{inputtwo_{k, j}} and \var{manpowertwo{k}} units of manpower are needed.
- Input from an industry in year t results in a (permanent) increase in productive capacity in year t + 2.
- Stocks of goods may be held from year to year. 
- At present (year 0), the stocks of industry \var{k} is \var{stock_{k}}, and the capacity of industry \var{k} is \var{capacity_{k}}.
- An exogenous consumption requirement of \var{demand_{k}} units from industry \var{k} has to be satisfied in every year except year 0.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "inputone": [[inputone_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
    "manpowerone": [manpowerone_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "inputtwo": [[inputtwo_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
    "manpowertwo": [manpowertwo_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "stock": [stock_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "capacity": [capacity_{k} for k in 1,...,K],
    "demand": [demand_{k} for k in 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Maximize the total manpower requirement over five years

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{produce} represents the amount of units produced by each industry in each year
- \var{buildcapa} represents the amount of units used to build productive capacity for each industry in each year
- \var{stockhold} represents the amount of stock of each industry held in each year

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "produce": [[produce_{k, t} for t in 1,...,T] for k in 1,...,K],
    "buildcapa": [[buildcapa_{k, t} for t in 1,...,T] for k in 1,...,K],
    "stockhold": [[stock_{k, t} for t in 1,...,T] for for k in 1,...,K]

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this linear programming problem, we will use variables to represent the amount of production, capacity building, and stockholding for each industry over a five-year period. The objective is to maximize the total manpower requirement over these five years while satisfying the constraints of demand, capacity, and input requirements.

Below is the mathematical formulation in LaTeX:

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

\subsection*{Sets}
\begin{align*}
K & = \text{Number of industries} \\
T & = \text{Number of years (5)}
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{align*}
\text{inputone}_{k,j} & = \text{Input needed from industry } j \text{ by industry } k \text{ for production (\(\forall k, j\))} \\
\text{manpowerone}_{k} & = \text{Manpower units needed by industry } k \text{ for production} \\
\text{inputtwo}_{k,j} & = \text{Input needed from industry } j \text{ by industry } k \text{ for capacity building (\(\forall k, j\))} \\
\text{manpowertwo}_{k} & = \text{Manpower units needed by industry } k \text{ for capacity building} \\
\text{stock}_{k} & = \text{Initial stock of industry } k \\
\text{capacity}_{k} & = \text{Initial capacity of industry } k \\
\text{demand}_{k} & = \text{Exogenous consumption demand from industry } k \text{ (for \(t = 1, \ldots, T\))}
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{align*}
\text{produce}_{k,t} & = \text{Units produced by industry } k \text{ in year } t \\
\text{buildcapa}_{k,t} & = \text{Units used for building capacity of industry } k \text{ in year } t \\
\text{stockhold}_{k,t} & = \text{Stock of industry } k \text{ held at the end of year } t
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Maximize the total manpower usage over five years:
\[
\max \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sum_{k=1}^{K} (\text{manpowerone}_{k} \cdot \text{produce}_{k,t} + \text{manpowertwo}_{k} \cdot \text{buildcapa}_{k,t})
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

\paragraph{Production Capacity Constraints:}
For each industry \(k\) and year \(t\):
\[
\text{produce}_{k,t} + \text{buildcapa}_{k,t} \leq \text{capacity}_{k} + \sum_{\tau=1}^{t-2} \text{buildcapa}_{k,\tau}, \quad t \geq 1
\]

\paragraph{Stock Balance Constraints:}
For each industry \(k\) and year \(t\):
\[
\text{stockhold}_{k,t} = \text{stockhold}_{k,t-1} + \text{produce}_{k,t} - \sum_{j=1}^{K} \text{inputone}_{j,k} \cdot \text{produce}_{j,t} - \text{demand}_{k}, \quad t \geq 1
\]
\[
\text{stockhold}_{k,0} = \text{stock}_{k}
\]

\paragraph{Non-negativity Constraints:}
\[
\text{produce}_{k,t} \geq 0, \quad \text{buildcapa}_{k,t} \geq 0, \quad \text{stockhold}_{k,t} \geq 0, \quad \forall k, \forall t
\]

This LaTeX code models the given economic scenario with input and manpower constraints while aiming to maximize manpower over five years. It considers the necessary constraints related to production, stockholding, and capacity building, ensuring that annual demands are fulfilled.
