PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
        for id in 1, ..., m
    ],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this transportation problem as a linear programming problem, we will define our decision variables, constraints, and the objective function in the following manner:

Let \( x_{i,j} \) be the amount of soybeans shipped from city \( i \) to city \( j \).

**Objective Function:**
Minimize the total transportation cost:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad Z = \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j}
\]

**Constraints:**

1. **Supply Constraints:**
   Each source terminal \( k \) can only supply up to its available supply:

   \[
   \sum_{j: (k,j) \in A} x_{k,j} \leq \text{supply}_{k}, \quad \forall \text{ terminal } k
   \]

2. **Demand Constraints:**
   Each destination \( l \) must receive the required demand:

   \[
   \sum_{i: (i,l) \in A} x_{i,l} \geq \text{demand}_{l}, \quad \forall \text{ destination } l
   \]

3. **Non-Negativity Constraints:**
   The shipment amounts cannot be negative:

   \[
   x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall (i,j) \in A
   \]

Given this problem structure, we can represent it in LaTeX as follows:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Soybean Transportation Linear Programming Model}

\subsection*{Objective Function}

Minimize the total transportation cost:

\[
Z = \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

1. \textbf{Supply Constraints:}

\[
\sum_{j: (k,j) \in A} x_{k,j} \leq \text{supply}_{k}, \quad \forall \text{ terminal } k
\]

2. \textbf{Demand Constraints:}

\[
\sum_{i: (i,l) \in A} x_{i,l} \geq \text{demand}_{l}, \quad \forall \text{ destination } l
\]

3. \textbf{Non-Negativity Constraints:}

\[
x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall (i,j) \in A
\]

\end{document}
```

This LaTeX code outlines the structure of the linear programming problem, defining both the objective function and the constraints necessary to solve the transportation problem for minimizing costs.
