PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A delivery person starts at the intersection of \var{1}th Avenue and \var{1}th Street and needs to reach the intersection of \var{W}th Avenue and \var{N}th Street.
- The path between these two points forms a \var{N-1} Ã— \var{W-1} grid.
- Each block on the grid has a unique walking time due to varying pedestrian traffic during rush hour.
- The delivery person can only walk north or west.
- The journey can be broken down into \var{m} stages, where at each stage the delivery person decides to walk either north or west.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w+1}th Avenue and \var{n}th Stree is \var{west_time_{n,w}}.
- When at the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n}th Street, the time to move to the intersection of \var{w}th Avenue and \var{n+1}th Stree is \var{north_time_{n,w}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "west_time": [[west_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W-1] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "north_time": [[north_{n,w} for w in 1, ..., W] for n in 1, ..., N-1],
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the optimal path the delivery person should take to ensure the package is delivered in the least amount of time.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_time} represents total time taken to travel this path
- \var{paths} represents the flow going through the corresponding path

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "paths": [(street_{n}, avenue_{w}) for id in 1, ..., m]
    "total_time": total_travel_time
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem as a Linear Programming (LP) problem, we need to find a way to represent this path optimization in terms of linear equations. 

We can model this problem as a shortest path finding problem on a grid where the edges have weights corresponding to the walking times (given by `west_time` and `north_time`). Since the delivery person can only walk north or west, each path in the grid corresponds to a feasible sequence of moves from the starting point to the destination.

The objective is to minimize the total travel time from the start at `(1,1)` to the destination at `(W,N)`. The decision variables correspond to whether a particular path (move north or west from a grid point) is chosen in the optimal path.

Let's outline the mathematical model using Linear Programming:

Decision Variables:
- \( x_{n,w}^{\text{north}} \): Binary decision variable that is 1 if the delivery person moves north from the intersection of Street `n` and Avenue `w`, 0 otherwise.
- \( x_{n,w}^{\text{west}} \): Binary decision variable that is 1 if the delivery person moves west from the intersection of Street `n` and Avenue `w`, 0 otherwise.

Objective Function:
- Minimize the total travel time.

Constraints:
- Ensure that the delivery person moves only one step at a time, either north or west.
- Ensure that the delivery path starts at the starting point and ends at the destination point.
- Flow conservation constraints at each intersection, except for the starting and ending points.

Below is the mathematical formulation written in LaTeX:

\section*{Mathematical Model}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_{n,w}^{\text{north}} \) be the binary variable indicating movement north from intersection \((n, w)\).
    \item \( x_{n,w}^{\text{west}} \) be the binary variable indicating movement west from intersection \((n, w)\).
    \item \( \text{west\_time}_{n,w} \) be the time taken to move from intersection \((n, w)\) to \((n, w+1)\).
    \item \( \text{north\_time}_{n,w} \) be the time taken to move from intersection \((n, w)\) to \((n+1, w)\).
\end{itemize}

Objective Function:
\[
\min \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{w=1}^{W-1} \left( \text{west\_time}_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w}^{\text{west}} \right) + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{w=1}^{W} \left( \text{north\_time}_{n,w} \cdot x_{n,w}^{\text{north}} \right)
\]

Subject to:
\begin{align*}
    & x_{1,1}^{\text{north}} + x_{1,1}^{\text{west}} = 1 & \text{(Start at (1,1))}\\
    & x_{N,W} = 1 & \text{(End at (N,W))}\\
    & \sum_{j=1}^{B-1} \left( x_{j,i}^{\text{north}} + x_{j,i}^{\text{west}} \right) = \sum_{j=0}^{A} \left( x_{i,j}^{\text{north}} + x_{i,j}^{\text{west}} \right) & \forall n \in \{2, \ldots, N-1\}, \forall w \in \{2, \ldots, W-1\} & \text{(Flow conservation)}\\
    & x_{n,w}^{\text{north}}, x_{n,w}^{\text{west}} \in \{0, 1\} & \forall n, w
\end{align*}

\end{document}
```

This model ensures the delivery person takes the optimal path in terms of least time while respecting the constraints of movement on the grid. The solution to this LP model will provide the optimal path and the minimum total travel time.
