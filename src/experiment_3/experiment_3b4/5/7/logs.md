PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "x_0": x_0,
    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,
    "T": T
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is max_t |a_t|. 

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "fuel_spend" contains the total fuel spent by the rocket

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "v": [v_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "a": [a_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "fuel_spend": fuel_spent,

\subsection*{Parameters and Variables}

We are given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial position, $x_0$
    \item Initial velocity, $v_0$
    \item Target position at time $T$, $x_T$
    \item Target velocity at time $T$, $v_T$
    \item Time period $T$
\end{itemize}

Define variables:
\begin{align*}
    x_t &: \text{Position of the rocket at time } t, \, t = 0, 1, \ldots, T \\
    v_t &: \text{Velocity of the rocket at time } t, \, t = 0, 1, \ldots, T \\
    a_t &: \text{Acceleration (thrust) of the rocket at time } t, \, t = 1, 2, \ldots, T \\
    M &: \text{Maximum thrust } = \max_t |a_t|, \, t = 1, 2, \ldots, T
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Objective}

Minimize the maximum thrust:
\[
\min M
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

The system dynamics are modeled by the following constraints:
\begin{align}
    x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \label{eq:position_update} \\
    v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \label{eq:velocity_update}
\end{align}

Initial conditions:
\begin{align}
    x_0 &= \text{given initial position} \\
    v_0 &= \text{given initial velocity}
\end{align}

Target conditions at time $T$:
\begin{align}
    x_T &= \text{target position} \\
    v_T &= \text{target velocity}
\end{align}

Thrust constraints:
\begin{align}
    -M &\leq a_t \leq M, \quad t = 1, 2, \ldots, T
\end{align}

Fuel consumption:
\[
\text{Fuel spent} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Summary}

The goal is to determine:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_t$ for all $t = 1, \ldots, T$
    \item $v_t$ for all $t = 1, \ldots, T$
    \item $a_t$ for all $t = 1, \ldots, T$
    \item Total fuel spent
\end{itemize}
