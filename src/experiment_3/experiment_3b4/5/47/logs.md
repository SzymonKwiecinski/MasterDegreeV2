PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- The town has \var{S} different shifts for the police officers during the day.
- During each shift \var{s}, the town requires \var{officers_needed_{s}} police officers on duty.
- Each police officer works for two consecutive shifts.
- The cost for the town when starting a shift at \var{s} is \var{shift_cost_{s}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "officers_needed": [officers_needed_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "shift_costs": [shift_cost_{s} for s in 1, ..., S]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many officers should the town assign to each shift in order to minimize the total cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- The number of officers assigned to each shift \var{officers_assigned_{s}}.
- \var{total_cost} indicates the total cost for the town.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "officers_assigned": [officers_assigned_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem as a Linear Programming (LP) problem, we need to define the decision variables, constraints, and the objective function. 

Let's denote the number of officers that start working at shift \( s \) as \( x_s \). Since each officer works for two consecutive shifts, the officers starting at shift \( s \) will cover shift \( s \) and shift \( s+1 \). 

The constraints will ensure that the number of officers on duty for each shift \( s \) meets the required number of officers. The objective is to minimize the total cost based on the number of officers starting each shift and the associated cost.

Here's the mathematical model formulated in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Model}

\subsection*{Sets and Indices}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( S \): Total number of shifts.
    \item \( s \): Index for shifts, \( s = 1, 2, \ldots, S \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{officers\_needed}_s \): Number of officers needed for shift \( s \).
    \item \( \text{shift\_cost}_s \): Cost for starting officers at shift \( s \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_s \): Number of officers starting their shift at \( s \) (non-negative integers).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total cost of assigning officers:
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{s=1}^{S} \text{shift\_cost}_s \cdot x_s
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Coverage Constraints:}
    \begin{align*}
        x_1 + x_S &\geq \text{officers\_needed}_1 \\
        x_2 + x_1 &\geq \text{officers\_needed}_2 \\
        &\vdots \\
        x_S + x_{S-1} &\geq \text{officers\_needed}_S \\
    \end{align*}
    Each constraint ensures that the number of officers covering a shift meets the required number.

    \item \textbf{Non-negativity Constraints:}
    \[
    x_s \geq 0 \quad \forall s = 1, 2, \ldots, S
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Variables are Integers}
Since the number of officers is discrete, \( x_s \) should be integer values. However, if this is an LP relaxation, integer constraints might be omitted.

\end{document}
```

This model addresses the problem by ensuring sufficient coverage for each shift while minimizing the total cost associated with deploying officers for the required shifts.
