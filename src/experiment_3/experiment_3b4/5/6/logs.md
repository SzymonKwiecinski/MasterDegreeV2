PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT:

    "x_0": x_0,
    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,
    "T": T
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the total fuel \sum_{t=0}^{\var{T}-1} |\var{a_t}| spent subject to the preceding constraints.

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "fuel_spend" contains the total fuel spent by the rocket

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "v": [v_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "a": [a_i for i in 1, ..., T],

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Rocket Path Optimization}

\subsection*{Objective:}
Minimize the total fuel spent, which is the sum of the absolute values of the accelerations over the time period from $t = 0$ to $t = T-1$.

\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\subsection*{Subject to:}
1. Dynamics of the rocket:
   \[
   x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]
   \[
   v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t \quad \text{for } t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
   \]

2. Initial conditions:
   \[
   x_0 = x_0 \quad \text{(given)}
   \]
   \[
   v_0 = v_0 \quad \text{(given)}
   \]

3. Final conditions:
   \[
   x_T = x_T \quad \text{(target position)}
   \]
   \[
   v_T = v_T \quad \text{(target velocity)}
   \]

\subsection*{Variables:}

The given model describes the motion of a rocket, including its position and velocity dynamics over discrete time steps. The decision variables of this problem are the accelerations at each time step, which are controlled to minimize fuel usage while ensuring the rocket reaches the target position and velocity at the final time step. The problem also accounts for absolute acceleration, a proxy for fuel consumption, which is minimized across all time steps.
