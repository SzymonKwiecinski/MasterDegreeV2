PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A large company wishes to move some of its departments out of London. 
- There are benefits to be derived from doing this (cheaper housing, government incentives, easier recruitment, etc.), which have been costed. 
- Also, however, there will be greater costs of communication between departments. 
- These have also been costed for all possible locations of each department.
- The company comprises several departmens. 
- There are several possible cities for relocation, or a department may be kept in London. 
- None of these cities (including London) may be the location for more than three of the departments.
- Benefits for department \var{k} from relocation at city \var{l} is \var{benefit_{k, l}} (in thousands of pounds).
- Communication costs are of the form \var{communication_{k, j}} * \var{cost_{l, m}}.
- \var{communication_{k, j}} is the quantity of communication between department \var{k} and city \var{j}.
- \var{cost_{l, m}} is the unit cost of communication between city \var{l} and city \var{m}.


INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"benefit": [[benefit_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...,K],
	"communication": [[communication_{k, j} for j in 1,...,K] for k in 1,...,K],
	"cost": [[cost_{l, m} for m in 1,...,L] for l in 1,...,L],
}


OBJECTIVE: Where should each department be located so as to minimize overall yearly cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{islocated_{k, l}} represents whether department \var{k} is relocated at city \var{l}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "islocated": [[islocated_{k, l} for l in 1,...,L] for k in 1,...K],
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model the given problem as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem, we need to define decision variables, the objective function, and the constraints.

######### Decision Variables:
- Let \( x_{k,l} \) be a binary decision variable such that:
  - \( x_{k,l} = 1 \) if department \( k \) is located in city \( l \),
  - \( x_{k,l} = 0 \) otherwise.

######### Objective Function:
We aim to minimize the overall cost, which includes the benefits from relocation and communication costs.

- **Benefits:**
  The benefit for department \( k \) in city \( l \) is given by \( benefit_{k,l} \).

- **Communication Costs:**
  The communication cost between department \( k \) in city \( l \) and department \( j \) in city \( m \) is given by:
  \[
  \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{j=1}^{K} \sum_{m=1}^{L} \text{communication}_{k,j} \cdot \text{cost}_{l,m} \cdot x_{k,l} \cdot x_{j,m}
  \]

- The objective function to minimize is:
  \[
  \text{Objective: } \min \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( -\text{benefit}_{k,l} \cdot x_{k,l} \right) + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{j=1}^{K} \sum_{m=1}^{L} \text{communication}_{k,j} \cdot \text{cost}_{l,m} \cdot x_{k,l} \cdot x_{j,m}
  \]

######### Constraints:
1. **Each department must be located in exactly one city:**
   \[
   \sum_{l=1}^{L} x_{k,l} = 1 \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K
   \]

2. **No city can have more than three departments:**
   \[
   \sum_{k=1}^{K} x_{k,l} \leq 3 \quad \forall l = 1, \ldots, L
   \]

3. **Binary constraints for decision variables:**
   \[
   x_{k,l} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K, \quad l = 1, \ldots, L
   \]

Here is the mathematical model in LaTeX:

x_{k,l} &= 
\begin{cases}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
\begin{align*}

\end{align*}

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{align*}
&\text{1. Each department must be located in exactly one city:} \\
&\sum_{l=1}^{L} x_{k,l} = 1, \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K \\

&\text{2. No city can have more than three departments:} \\
&\sum_{k=1}^{K} x_{k,l} \leq 3, \quad \forall l = 1, \ldots, L \\

&\text{3. Binary constraints for decision variables:} \\
&x_{k,l} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall k = 1, \ldots, K, \quad l = 1, \ldots, L \\
\end{align*}
