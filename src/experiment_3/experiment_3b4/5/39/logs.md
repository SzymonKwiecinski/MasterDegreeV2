PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- To operate a cafeteria, the manager must ensure on-call duty based on the statistics on the required staff. 
- In the future days, the number of desired employees on day \var{n} is denoted with \var{num_{n}}.
- Each employee works \var{n_working_days} days in a row and then has \var{n_resting_days} days off.

OBJECTIVE: Calculate the minimum number of employees to hire

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_number} represents the total number of employees to employ
- \var{is_work} represents whether employee is working a rest on each day. Its length is determined by \var{total_number}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To formulate this problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, we need to consider the scheduling constraints based on the working and resting days, as well as the requirement to minimize the total number of employees hired. Here's how you can structure this problem:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\section*{Problem Formulation}

We are given the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\text{num}_n\): Required number of employees for each day \(n\), where \(n = 1, \ldots, N\).
    \item \(\text{n\_working\_days}\): Number of consecutive days an employee works.
    \item \(\text{n\_resting\_days}\): Number of consecutive days an employee rests after working.
\end{itemize}

Define the variables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(x_i\): Binary variable indicating if employee \(i\) is employed.
    \item \(y_{n,i}\): Binary variable indicating if employee \(i\) is working on day \(n\).
\end{itemize}

The objective is to minimize the total number of employees hired:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{M} x_i
\]

Where \(M\) is a sufficiently large number representing a potential pool of employees to consider.

Subject to the constraints:

1. Each day \(n\) must have the required number of employees:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{M} y_{n,i} \geq \text{num}_n, \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}
\]

2. Ensure that an employee works for \(\text{n\_working\_days}\) followed by \(\text{n\_resting\_days}\). This can be expressed with the following logical constraints:

For each employee \(i\), if they start working on day \(n\), then:

\[
y_{n+k,i} = 1, \quad \forall k \in \{0, \ldots, \text{n\_working\_days} - 1\}, \quad \text{if}\; x_i = 1
\]
\[
y_{n+k,i} = 0, \quad \forall k \in \{\text{n\_working\_days}, \ldots, \text{n\_working\_days} + \text{n\_resting\_days} - 1\}, \quad \text{if}\; x_i = 1
\]

3. The working constraint for \(y_{n,i}\) should depend on \(x_i\) (i.e., an employee cannot work if not hired):

\[
y_{n,i} \leq x_i, \quad \forall n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}, \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, M\}
\]

Given these constraints, solving the MILP will yield the optimal number of employees to hire along with their schedules.

\end{document}
```

This formulation captures the essence of the scheduling problem by setting up constraints to satisfy daily staffing requirements and managing the working/resting pattern for each hired employee. The challenge is ensuring the constraints correctly capture the sequential work-rest pattern. The logic constraint is simplified here but would be implemented using additional auxiliary variables and constraints in a real MILP solver due to linearity requirements.
