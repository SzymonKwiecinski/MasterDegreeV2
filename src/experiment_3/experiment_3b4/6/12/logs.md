PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Suppose that there are \var{N} available currencies, and assume that one unit of currency \var{i} can be exchanged for \var{rate_{i,j}} units of currency \var{j} (Naturally, we assume that \var{rate_{i,j}} > 0).
- There are also certain regulations that impose a limit \var{limit_i} on the total amount of currency \var{i} that can be exchanged (whether to other currencies or from other currencies) on any given day.
- Suppose that we start the day with \var{start_i} units of currency \var{i}
- Provide a linear programming formulation of this problem. Assume that for any sequence \var{i_1}, â€¦ ,\var{i_k} of currencies, we have \var{rate_{i_1,i_2}}, \var{rate_{i_2,i_3}}, ..., \var{rate_{i_{k-1}, i_{k}}, \var{rate_{i_k, i_1}} <= 1, which means that wealth cannot be multiplied by going through a cycle of currencies.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "start": [start_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "limit": [limit_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "rate": [[rate_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., N] for i in 1, ..., N],
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to maximize the number of units of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day, through a sequence of currency transactions.

OUTPUT INFO: 

- The output json file contains a list of transactions, where each transaction is a json object with the following fields:
    - from: the currency that we are exchanging from
    - to: the currency that we are exchanging to
    - amount: the amount of currency that we are exchanging
- The output json file also contains the final amount of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day.

OUTPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": i,
            "to": j,
            "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
    ],
    "final_amount_of_currency_N": final_amount_of_currency_N

To formulate the given problem as a Linear Programming (LP) model in LaTeX, we need to define the decision variables, the objective function, and the constraints. The goal is to maximize the amount of currency \(N\) at the end of the day, given the constraints on exchange rates and limits. Below is the LaTeX code for the LP formulation:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Formulation}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
Let \( x_{i,j} \) be the amount of currency \( i \) to be exchanged for currency \( j \) for all \( i, j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\} \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Maximize the total amount of currency \( N \) at the end of the day:
\[
\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i,N} \times \text{rate}_{i,N}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Currency Exchange Limit Constraints:
    \[
    \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} \leq \text{limit}_i, \quad \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}
    \]

    \item Starting Currency Constraints:
    \[
    \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{j,i} \leq \text{start}_i, \quad \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}
    \]

    \item Non-negativity Constraints:
    \[
    x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall i, j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}
    \]

    \item Constraint on exchange rate cycle (implicit constraint stating that wealth cannot multiply through cycles)
    \[
    \prod_{k=1}^{K} \text{rate}_{i_k, i_{k+1}} \leq 1, \quad \text{for any cycle } i_1 \rightarrow i_2 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow i_K \rightarrow i_1
    \]
\end{enumerate}

\end{document}
```

In this formulation:
- \( x_{i,j} \) represents the amount of currency \( i \) exchanged for currency \( j \).
- The objective is to maximize the sum of the final amounts of currency \( N \) obtained from all other currencies, taking into account the conversion rates.
- The first set of constraints ensures that the sum of currency exchanged from any currency \( i \) does not exceed its limit.
- The second set of constraints ensures that the sum of currency exchanged to any currency \( i \) does not exceed the starting amount of that currency.
- Non-negativity constraints ensure that exchange amounts are non-negative.
- The implicit cycle constraint is provided as a condition, ensuring that wealth cannot be cyclically multiplied. 

The model is constructed such that it fulfills the exchange regulations and aims to maximize the obtainment of the desired currency.
