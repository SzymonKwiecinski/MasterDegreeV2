PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A quantity y is known to depend on another quantity x. A set of corresponding values has been collected for x and y and is presented.
- The \var{k}-th y value takes \var{y_{k}} and the \var{k}-th x value takes \var{x_{k}}.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "y": [y_{k} for k = 1,...,K],
    "x": [x_{k} for k = 1,...,K]
}


OBJECTIVE: Fit the ‘best’ straight line y = bx + a to this set of data points. The objective is to minimise the sum of absolute deviations of each observed value of y from the value predicted by the linear relationship.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{intercept} represents the intercept of the fitted line
- \var{slope} represents the slope of the fitted line

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "intercept": intercept,
    "slope": slope
}

To solve the problem of fitting the best straight line \( y = bx + a \) to the given data points by minimizing the sum of absolute deviations, we need to formulate it as a linear programming problem. The main task is to minimize the sum of absolute deviations from the observed values. 

Here is how we would structure the mathematical model in LATEX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

To fit a line \( y = bx + a \) to a given set of data points \((x_k, y_k) \text{ for } k = 1, \ldots, K\), we aim to minimize the sum of the absolute deviations of the observed values \( y_k \) from the predicted values \( bx_k + a \).

The objective function can be expressed as:

\[
\min \sum_{k=1}^{K} |y_k - (bx_k + a)|
\]

To handle the absolute value, we introduce non-negative variables \( d_k^+ \) and \( d_k^- \) for each \( k \) such that:

\[
d_k^+ \geq y_k - (bx_k + a)
\]
\[
d_k^- \geq -(y_k - (bx_k + a))
\]

Instead of minimizing the absolute value, we minimize the sum of these deviations:

\[
\min \sum_{k=1}^{K} (d_k^+ + d_k^-)
\]

Thus, the linear programming problem becomes:

\[
\begin{align*}
\min & \quad \sum_{k=1}^{K} (d_k^+ + d_k^-) \\
\text{subject to:} & \\
& d_k^+ \geq y_k - (bx_k + a), \quad k = 1, \ldots, K \\
& d_k^- \geq -(y_k - (bx_k + a)), \quad k = 1, \ldots, K \\
& d_k^+, d_k^- \geq 0, \quad k = 1, \ldots, K
\end{align*}
\]

This is a linear programming problem where:
- We need to find the values of \( a \) (intercept) and \( b \) (slope) that minimize the objective.
- The constraints ensure the deviations \( d_k^+ \) and \( d_k^- \) are non-negative and properly account for the absolute deviations.

\end{document}
```

To solve this linear programming problem, you can use optimization software such as CPLEX, Gurobi, or open-source alternatives like Linprog in MATLAB or SciPy's linprog in Python, which can handle the linear constraints and objective function as formulated. The result will give you the optimal values of the intercept \( a \) and the slope \( b \).

To fit a line \( y = bx + a \) to a given set of data points \((x_k, y_k) \text{ for } k = 1, \ldots, K\), we aim to minimize the sum of the absolute deviations of the observed values \( y_k \) from the predicted values \( bx_k + a \).

\[
d_k^+ \geq y_k - (bx_k + a)

Instead of minimizing the absolute value, we minimize the sum of these deviations:

\[
\min \sum_{k=1}^{K} (d_k^+ + d_k^-)
\]

Thus, the linear programming problem becomes:

\[

& d_k^+, d_k^- \geq 0, \quad k = 1, \ldots, K
\end{align*}
\]

This is a linear programming problem where:
- We need to find the values of \( a \) (intercept) and \( b \) (slope) that minimize the objective.
- The constraints ensure the deviations \( d_k^+ \) and \( d_k^- \) are non-negative and properly account for the absolute deviations.
