\textbf{Objective:}

Minimize the sum of absolute deviations:
\[
\min \sum_{k=1}^{K} e_k
\]

where \( e_k \) represents the absolute deviation for each data point.

\textbf{Subject to:}

For each data point \( k \), introduce constraints to linearize the absolute value:

\[
y_k - (c \cdot x_k^2 + b \cdot x_k + a) \leq e_k
\]

\[
(c \cdot x_k^2 + b \cdot x_k + a) - y_k \leq e_k
\]

These constraints ensure that \( e_k \) is at least as large as the positive or negative deviation from the predicted value.

\textbf{Variables:}

- \( a \): constant term
- \( b \): linear term
- \( c \): quadratic term
- \( e_k \): absolute deviation for each data point \( k \)

\textbf{Solution:}

The solution will provide the coefficients for the quadratic function, which are:

- Quadratic coefficient (\(c\))
- Linear coefficient (\(b\))
- Constant coefficient (\(a\))
