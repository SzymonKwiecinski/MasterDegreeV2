PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To formulate the given problem as a linear programming (LP) model, we aim to minimize the maximum thrust required, represented by \(\max_t |a_t|\), subject to the discretized system dynamics and initial and final conditions. Here's the mathematical model in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model for Rocket Path Optimization}

\subsection*{Given:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial position: \(x_0\)
    \item Initial velocity: \(v_0\)
    \item Target position at time \(T\): \(x_T\)
    \item Target velocity at time \(T\): \(v_T\)
    \item Time horizon: \(T\)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective:}
Minimize the maximum thrust required, i.e., \(\max_{t} |a_t|\).

\subsection*{Constraints:}
\begin{align}
    & x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1, \\
    & v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1, \\
    & x_0 \text{ is given}, \\
    & v_0 \text{ is given}, \\
    & x_T \text{ is given}, \\
    & v_T \text{ is given}.
\end{align}

\subsection*{Decision Variables:}
\begin{align}
    & x_t, \quad \text{position of the rocket at time } t, \\
    & v_t, \quad \text{velocity of the rocket at time } t, \\
    & a_t, \quad \text{acceleration (thrust) of the rocket at time } t.
\end{align}

\subsection*{Objective Function:}
\begin{align}
    \text{Minimize } & M, \\
    \text{subject to } & -M \leq a_t \leq M, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1.
\end{align}

\subsection*{Fuel Spend:}
The total fuel spent is equivalent to the sum of the magnitude of accelerations:
\begin{align}
    \text{Fuel Spend} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|.
\end{align}

\end{document}
```

This model captures the dynamics of the rocket's movement and allows for the minimization of the maximum absolute acceleration, which correlates to minimizing the maximum thrust and, consequently, the fuel consumption. The total fuel spend is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the accelerations across the time horizon.
