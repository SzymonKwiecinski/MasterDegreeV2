PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- To operate a cafeteria, the manager must ensure on-call duty based on the statistics on the required staff. 
- In the future days, the number of desired employees on day \var{n} is denoted with \var{num_{n}}.
- Each employee works \var{n_working_days} days in a row and then has \var{n_resting_days} days off.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"num": [num_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"n_working_days": n_working_days,
	"n_resting_days": n_resting_days
}


OBJECTIVE: Calculate the minimum number of employees to hire

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_number} represents the total number of employees to employ
- \var{is_work} represents whether employee is working a rest on each day. Its length is determined by \var{total_number}

## START MESSAGE 1 
### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To address the given problem, we need to formulate a Linear Programming (LP) model that minimizes the number of employees required to meet the daily staffing needs while adhering to the working and resting days constraints.

Let's define the decision variables:

- \( x_i \): Binary variable indicating whether employee \( i \) is employed (1 if employed, 0 otherwise).
- \( y_{n,i} \): Binary variable indicating whether employee \( i \) is working on day \( n \) (1 if working, 0 otherwise).

We aim to minimize the number of employees hired, while ensuring the required number of employees are working each day.

The constraints are based on:

1. Each employee works for \( n_{\text{working\_days}} \) consecutively, followed by at least \( n_{\text{resting\_days}} \) days off.
2. The number of employees working each day must meet or exceed the required \( \text{num}_{n} \) for each day.

Here is the mathematical model in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsthm}
\begin{document}

\section*{Mathematical Formulation}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( N \): Total number of days.
    \item \(\text{num}_{n}\): Required number of employees on day \( n \).
    \item \( n_{\text{working\_days}} \): Number of consecutive working days for each employee.
    \item \( n_{\text{resting\_days}} \): Number of consecutive resting days for each employee.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_i \in \{0, 1\} \): 1 if employee \( i \) is employed, 0 otherwise.
    \item \( y_{n,i} \in \{0, 1\} \): 1 if employee \( i \) works on day \( n \), 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective}
\begin{align*}
    \min \sum_{i=1}^{T} x_i
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Constraints}

\begin{align*}
    &\sum_{i=1}^{T} y_{n,i} \geq \text{num}_{n}, \quad \forall n = 1, 2, \ldots, N \\
    &\sum_{k=0}^{n_{\text{working\_days}} - 1} y_{n+k,i} \leq n_{\text{working\_days}} \cdot x_i, \quad \forall i, \quad \forall n = 1, 2, \ldots, N - n_{\text{working\_days}} + 1 \\
    &y_{n,i} = 0, \quad \forall i, \quad \forall n \text{ where } (n \mod (n_{\text{working\_days}} + n_{\text{resting\_days}})) \geq n_{\text{working\_days}} \\
    &x_i \in \{0, 1\}, \quad y_{n,i} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall i, n
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Explanation}

- The first constraint ensures that the required number of employees are working each day.
- The second constraint ensures that if an employee is working, they don't work more than \( n_{\text{working\_days}} \) consecutive days.
- The third constraint ensures that employees take the required rest days after their consecutive working period.

\end{document}
```

This model will determine the minimum number of employees required (\( x_i \)) and whether each employee is working on a given day (\( y_{n,i} \)), respecting the working and resting period constraints.
