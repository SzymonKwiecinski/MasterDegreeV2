PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- The town has \var{S} different shifts for the police officers during the day.
- During each shift \var{s}, the town requires \var{officers_needed_{s}} police officers on duty.
- Each police officer works for two consecutive shifts.
- The cost for the town when starting a shift at \var{s} is \var{shift_cost_{s}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "officers_needed": [officers_needed_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "shift_costs": [shift_cost_{s} for s in 1, ..., S]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many officers should the town assign to each shift in order to minimize the total cost?

OUTPUT INFO:

- The number of officers assigned to each shift \var{officers_assigned_{s}}.
- \var{total_cost} indicates the total cost for the town.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "officers_assigned": [officers_assigned_{s} for s in 1, ..., S],
    "total_cost": total_cost
}

To solve this problem using Linear Programming, we need to create a mathematical model that captures the constraints and the objective function. The goal is to minimize the total cost for the town while ensuring that the required number of police officers are on duty for each shift, given that each officer works for two consecutive shifts.

Let's denote:

- \( x_s \) as the number of officers starting at shift \( s \).

The constraints are:

1. For each shift \( s \), the number of officers on duty should be at least \( \text{officers\_needed}_s \). Since each officer works for two consecutive shifts, the number of officers on duty for shift \( s \) is the sum of officers starting at shifts \( s \) and \( (s-1) \).

2. The objective is to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of the costs incurred for officers starting at each shift multiplied by the number of officers starting at that shift.

Given these information, the linear programming model can be formulated as follows:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Objective:}
\[
\min \sum_{s=1}^{S} \text{shift\_cost}_s \cdot x_s
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}
\[
x_s + x_{s-1} \geq \text{officers\_needed}_s, \quad s = 1, 2, \ldots, S
\]

\[
x_s \geq 0 \quad \text{and integer}, \quad s = 1, 2, \ldots, S
\]

\textbf{Additional Constraints:}
\[
x_0 = x_S \quad \text{(officers starting at the last shift also apply to the first shift)}
\]

\end{document}
```

In this formulation:

- The objective function sums the cost over all shifts, each multiplied by the number of officers starting at that shift.
- The constraints ensure that the required number of officers are on duty for each shift by considering officers from the current and previous shifts.
- The problem assumes cyclic shifts (i.e., shift \( S \) rolls over to shift \( 1 \)), which is why we use the additional constraint \( x_0 = x_S \).

This formulation will help determine the number of officers to assign to each shift to minimize the total cost while meeting the town's requirements for police presence.
