PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A small computer manufacturing company forecasts the demand over the next \var{n}-th month to be \var{demand_{n}}.
- These demands must be satisfied and can not be shorted.
- In any month it can produce at most \var{max_regular_amount} units, using regular production, at a cost of \var{cost_regular} dollars per unit. 
- By using overtime, it can produce additional units at \var{cost_overtime} dollars per unit. 
- The firm can store units from month to month at a cost of \var{store_cost} dollars per unit per month. 

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"demand": [demand_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"max_regular_amount": max_regular_amount,
	"cost_regular": cost_regular,
	"cost_overtime": cost_overtime,
	"store_cost": store_cost
}


OBJECTIVE: Formulate the problem of determining the production schedule that minimizes the cost.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{reg_quant} represents the quantity of products produced using regular production in each future month
- \var{over_quant} represents the quantity of products produced using overtime production in each future month

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"reg_quant": [reg_quant_{n} for n in 1,...,N]
	"over_quant": [over_quant_{n} for n in 1,...,N]
}

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To formulate this problem as a linear programming model, we need to determine the production quantities (regular and overtime) and the storage quantities for each month, in a way that minimizes the cost of production and storage.

Let's denote:
- \( x_n \) as the number of units produced using regular production in month \( n \).
- \( y_n \) as the number of units produced using overtime production in month \( n \).
- \( s_n \) as the number of units stored at the end of month \( n \).

Given the problem constraints and cost structure, the mathematical model can be formulated as follows:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Objective:}
Minimize the total cost, which includes regular production, overtime production, and storage costs over \( N \) months.

\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{n=1}^{N} ( \text{cost\_regular} \cdot x_n + \text{cost\_overtime} \cdot y_n + \text{store\_cost} \cdot s_n)
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}
\begin{align*}
1. & \quad x_n + y_n + s_{n-1} = \text{demand}_n + s_n, \quad \forall n = 1, \ldots, N \\
2. & \quad x_n \leq \text{max\_regular\_amount}, \quad \forall n = 1, \ldots, N \\
3. & \quad x_n, y_n, s_n \geq 0, \quad \forall n = 1, \ldots, N \\
4. & \quad s_0 = 0 \quad (\text{initial inventory})
\end{align*}

\textbf{Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_n \): Regular production quantity in month \( n \)
    \item \( y_n \): Overtime production quantity in month \( n \)
    \item \( s_n \): Units stored at the end of month \( n \)
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

- Constraint 1 ensures that the units produced (regular and overtime) plus the units from storage at the start of each month meet the required demand and any storage for the next month.
- Constraint 2 restricts the number of units produced through regular production in any month to the maximum allowed.
- Constraint 3 ensures that production and storage quantities are non-negative.
- The initial inventory is set to zero (constraint 4). 

By solving this Linear Programming problem, you can determine the optimal production schedule that minimizes costs for the given future months.
