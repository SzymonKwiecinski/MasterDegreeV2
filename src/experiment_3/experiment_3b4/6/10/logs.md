PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a school district with \var{N} neighborhoods, \var{S} schools, and \var{G} grades at each school.
- Each school \var{s} has a capacity of \var{capacity_{s,g}} for grade \var{g}. 
- In each neighborhood \var{n}, the student population of grade \var{g} is \var{population_{n,g}}. 
- Finally, the distance of school \var{s} from neighborhood \var{n} is \var{d_{i,j}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "capacity": [[capacity_{s,g} for g in 1, ..., G] for s in 1, ..., S],
    "population": [[population_{n,g} for g in 1, ..., G] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "distance": [[d_{n,s} for s in 1, ..., S] for n in 1, ..., N]
}

OBJECTIVE: We want to assign all students to schools, while minimizing the total distance traveled by all students. We may ignore the fact that numbers of students must be integers.

OUTPUT INFO:
- the output should show optimal \var{x_{n,s,g}} for all \var{n}, \var{s}, \var{g} (i.e., the number of students of grade \var{g} in neighborhood \var{n} assigned to school \var{s}).
- the output should also include \var{total_distance}, the total distance traveled by all students.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "assignment": [[[x_{n,s,g} for g in 1, ..., G] for s in 1, ..., S] for n in 1, ..., N],
    "total_distance": total_distance
}

The problem can be formulated as a Linear Programming (LP) problem. We need to assign students to schools such that the total traveled distance is minimized, while respecting the school capacity constraints and ensuring all students are assigned.

Let's define the variables and the optimization problem:

- Let \( x_{n,s,g} \) be the number of students of grade \( g \) from neighborhood \( n \) assigned to school \( s \).
- We need to minimize the total distance, given by \( \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{s=1}^{S} \sum_{g=1}^{G} d_{n,s} \cdot x_{n,s,g} \).

The constraints are:

1. **Capacity Constraint**: For every school \( s \) and grade \( g \), the total number of students from all neighborhoods assigned to this school for this grade must not exceed its capacity:
   \[
   \sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n,s,g} \leq \text{capacity}_{s,g}, \quad \forall s, g
   \]

2. **Population Constraint**: For every neighborhood \( n \) and grade \( g \), the total number of students from this neighborhood that are assigned to any school must equal the population:
   \[
   \sum_{s=1}^{S} x_{n,s,g} = \text{population}_{n,g}, \quad \forall n, g
   \]

The optimization problem can be written in LaTeX as follows:

\section*{Linear Programming Model for School Assignment Problem}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\[
x_{n,s,g} \geq 0
\]
- \( x_{n,s,g} \): Number of students of grade \( g \) from neighborhood \( n \) assigned to school \( s \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total distance traveled by all students:
\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{s=1}^{S} \sum_{g=1}^{G} d_{n,s} \cdot x_{n,s,g}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Capacity Constraints:}
    \[
    \sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n,s,g} \leq \text{capacity}_{s,g}, \quad \forall s, \forall g
    \]
    - Ensure that the number of students assigned to each school for each grade does not exceed its capacity.

    \item \textbf{Population Constraints:}
    \[
    \sum_{s=1}^{S} x_{n,s,g} = \text{population}_{n,g}, \quad \forall n, \forall g
    \]
    - Ensure that all students from each neighborhood in each grade are assigned to some school.
\end{itemize}

```

This LP problem can be solved using appropriate solvers (like Gurobi, CPLEX, or open-source solvers like GLPK) to find the optimal student assignments and the minimized total distance.
