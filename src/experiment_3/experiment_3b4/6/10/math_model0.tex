\section*{Linear Programming Model for School Assignment Problem}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\[
x_{n,s,g} \geq 0
\]
- \( x_{n,s,g} \): Number of students of grade \( g \) from neighborhood \( n \) assigned to school \( s \).

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Minimize the total distance traveled by all students:
\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{s=1}^{S} \sum_{g=1}^{G} d_{n,s} \cdot x_{n,s,g}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Capacity Constraints:}
    \[
    \sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n,s,g} \leq \text{capacity}_{s,g}, \quad \forall s, \forall g
    \]
    - Ensure that the number of students assigned to each school for each grade does not exceed its capacity.

    \item \textbf{Population Constraints:}
    \[
    \sum_{s=1}^{S} x_{n,s,g} = \text{population}_{n,g}, \quad \forall n, \forall g
    \]
    - Ensure that all students from each neighborhood in each grade are assigned to some school.
\end{itemize}
