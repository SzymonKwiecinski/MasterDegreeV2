PROBLEM TYPE: LP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements in future years. 
- Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. 
- In addition to this, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, which will reduce the need for workers in all categories.
- The estimated manpower requirements for manpower \var{k} in year \var{i} is \var{requirement_{k, i}}.
- The current strength of manpower \var{k} is \var{strength_{k}}.
- The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to recruitment, retraining, redundancy and short-time working in the next years.
- There is a natural wastage of labour. 
- A fairly large number of workers leave during their first year. After this, the rate is much smaller. 
- Taking this into account, the wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with less than one year's service is \var{lessonewaste_{k}}.
- The wastage rates of \var{k} manpower with more than one year's service is \var{moreonewaste_{k}}.
- There has been no recent recruitment and all workers in the current labour force have been employed for more than one year.
- It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. 
- In any one year, the numbers that can be recruited in manpower \var{k} is \var{recruit_{k}}.
- The redundancy payment to manpower \var{k} is \var{costredundancy_{k}}.
- It is possible to employ up to \var{num_overman} more workers over the whole company than are needed, but the extra costs per employee per year is \var{costoverman_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- Up to \var{num_shortwork} workers in each category of skill can be put on short-time working. 
- The cost of this (per employee per year) is \var{costshort_{k}} for manpower \var{k}.
- An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of half a full-time employee.

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this manpower planning problem as a linear programming problem, we need to define variables, constraints, and an objective function. The goal is to minimize the total cost associated with recruitment, redundancy, overmanning, and short-time working over a planning horizon of years.

Let's define the problem:

######### Decision Variables:
- \( \text{recruit}_{k,i} \): Number of manpower \( k \) recruited in year \( i \).
- \( \text{overmanning}_{k,i} \): Number of overmanned manpower \( k \) in year \( i \).
- \( \text{short}_{k,i} \): Number of short-time working manpower \( k \) in year \( i \).
- \( \text{redundant}_{k,i} \): Number of redundant manpower \( k \) in year \( i \).
- \( \text{employed}_{k,i} \): Number of employed manpower \( k \) at the start of year \( i \).

######### Objective Function:
Minimize the total cost, which includes recruitment costs, redundancy costs, overmanning costs, and short-time working costs.

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize} \quad & \sum_{i=1}^{I} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \left( \text{costredundancy}_{k} \cdot \text{redundant}_{k,i} + \text{costoverman}_{k} \cdot \text{overmanning}_{k,i} + \text{costshort}_{k} \cdot \text{short}_{k,i} \right)
\end{align*}
\]

######### Constraints:
1. **Manpower Balance**: For each year \( i \) and each manpower category \( k \),
\[
\text{employed}_{k,i} = \text{employed}_{k,i-1} \cdot (1 - \text{moreonewaste}_{k}) + \text{recruit}_{k,i} - \text{redundant}_{k,i}
\]
   - For year 1, use initial strength: 
   \[
   \text{employed}_{k,1} = \text{strength}_{k} \cdot (1 - \text{moreonewaste}_{k}) + \text{recruit}_{k,1} - \text{redundant}_{k,1}
   \]

2. **Satisfy Requirement**: 
\[
\text{employed}_{k,i} + \text{overmanning}_{k,i} \geq \text{requirement}_{k,i} - 0.5 \cdot \text{short}_{k,i}
\]

3. **Recruitment Limits**:
\[
0 \leq \text{recruit}_{k,i} \leq \text{recruit}_{k}
\]

4. **Redundancy Limits**:
\[
\text{redundant}_{k,i} \geq 0
\]

5. **Overmanning Limits**:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{overmanning}_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_overman}
\]

6. **Short-time Limits**:
\[
0 \leq \text{short}_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_shortwork}
\]

Now, let's represent the problem in LaTeX format with the above described linear programming model:

\end{align*}

\text{Short-time Limits:} \quad & 0 \leq \text{short}_{k,i} \leq \text{num\_shortwork} & \forall k, \forall i \\
\end{align*}
