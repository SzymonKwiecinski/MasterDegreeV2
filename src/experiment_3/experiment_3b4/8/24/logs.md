PROBLEM TYPE: MIP
PROBLEM INFO:

- A mining company is going to continue operating in a certain area for the next years. 
- There are \var{n_mines} mines in this area, but it can operate at most \var{n_maxwork} in any one year. 
- Although a mine may not operate in a certain year, it is still necessary to keep it ‘open’, in the sense that royalties are payable, if it be operated in a future year. 
- Clearly, if a mine is not going to be worked again, it can be permanently closed down and no more royalties need be paid. 
- The yearly royalties payable on each mine kept ‘open’ is \var{royalty_{k}} for mine \var{k}.
- There is an upper limit to the amount of ore, which can be extracted from each mine in a year. 
- The upper limit for mine \var{k} is \var{limit_{k}}.
- The ore from the different mines is of varying quality.
- This quality is measured on a scale so that blending ores together results in a linear combination of the quality measurements, for example, if equal quantities of two ores were combined, the resultant ore would have a quality measurement half way between
that of the ingredient ores. 
- The quality of ore from mine \var{k} is \var{quality_{k}}.
- In each year, it is necessary to combine the total outputs from each mine to produce a blended ore of exactly some stipulated quality.
- In year \var{i}, the required quality is \var{requiredquality_{i}}.
- The final blended ore sells for \var{price} ton each year. 
- Revenue and expenditure for future years must be discounted at a rate of \var{discount} per annum.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "n_mines": n_mines,
    "n_maxwork": n_maxwork,
    "royalty": [royalty_{k} for k in 1,...,K],

    "price": price,

}


OBJECTIVE: To maximize profit, which mines should be operated each year and how much should they produce?

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{isoperated} represents whether each mine is operated in each year
- \var{amount} represents the amount of ore produced by each mine in each year

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "isoperated": [[isoperated_{k, i} for i in 1,...,I] for k in 1,...K]
    "amount": [[amount_{k, i} for i in 1,...,I] for k in 1,...K]

To formulate this problem as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model, we need to define the decision variables, constraints, and the objective function.

Let's introduce the following decision variables:

- \( x_{k,i} \): Amount of ore extracted from mine \( k \) in year \( i \).
- \( y_{k,i} \): Binary variable indicating whether mine \( k \) is operated in year \( i \) (1 if operated, 0 otherwise).

The objective is to maximize the net present value (NPV) of the profit over the planning horizon. We calculate the profit for each year by subtracting the royalties from the revenue of selling the ore. The future revenues and royalties are discounted by the given discount rate.

Now, let's put this into a mathematical model in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Decision Variables:}
\[
\begin{align*}
x_{k,i} & : \text{Amount of ore extracted from mine } k \text{ in year } i, \\
y_{k,i} & : \text{Binary variable indicating if mine } k \text{ is operated in year } i.
\end{align*}
\]

\textbf{Objective Function:}
Maximize the Net Present Value (NPV) of the profit:
\[
\max \sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{1}{(1 + \text{discount})^i} \left( \sum_{k=1}^{K} \text{price} \cdot x_{k,i} - \text{royalty}_k \cdot y_{k,i} \right)
\]

\textbf{Constraints:}
\begin{align*}
& \sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{k,i} \leq \text{n\_maxwork}, & \forall i = 1,...,I \quad & \text{(Max number of mines operated)} \\
& x_{k,i} \leq \text{limit}_k \cdot y_{k,i}, & \forall k = 1,...,K, \forall i = 1,...,I \quad & \text{(Production limit based on operation)} \\
& \sum_{k=1}^{K} \frac{x_{k,i} \cdot \text{quality}_k}{\sum_{m=1}^{K} x_{m,i}} = \text{requiredquality}_i, & \forall i = 1,...,I \quad & \text{(Blended quality requirement)} \\
& y_{k,i} \in \{0, 1\}, & \forall k = 1,...,K, \forall i = 1,...,I \quad & \text{(Binary operation decision)} \\
& x_{k,i} \geq 0, & \forall k = 1,...,K, \forall i = 1,...,I \quad & \text{(Non-negativity)}
\end{align*}

\end{document}
```

This LaTeX code sets up the mathematical model for the given problem. The model includes both continuous and binary decision variables, objective function for maximizing profit, and several constraints that ensure operational limits, quality requirements, and logical constraints on mine operations.
