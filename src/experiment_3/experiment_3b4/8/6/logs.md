PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the total fuel \sum_{t=0}^{\var{T}-1} |\var{a_t}| spent subject to the preceding constraints.

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To formulate this problem as a linear programming problem (LP), we begin by defining the decision variables, objective function, and constraints based on the problem description.

######### Decision Variables:
- \( x_t \): Position of the rocket at time \( t \) for \( t = 1, \ldots, T \).
- \( v_t \): Velocity of the rocket at time \( t \) for \( t = 1, \ldots, T \).
- \( a_t \): Acceleration of the rocket at time \( t \) for \( t = 0, \ldots, T-1 \).

######### Parameters:
- \( x_0 \): Initial position.
- \( v_0 \): Initial velocity.
- \( x_T \): Target position at time \( T \).
- \( v_T \): Target velocity at time \( T \).
- \( T \): Total time steps.

######### Objective Function:
Minimize the total fuel consumption, which is equivalent to minimizing the sum of the absolute values of the accelerations:

\[
\min \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

######### Constraints:
1. Rocket motion equations:
   \[
   x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t \quad \text{for } t = 0, \ldots, T-1
   \]
   \[
   v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t \quad \text{for } t = 0, \ldots, T-1
   \]

2. Initial conditions:
   \[
   x_1 = x_0 + v_0
   \]
   \[
   v_1 = v_0 + a_0
   \]

3. Target conditions:
   \[
   x_T = x_T
   \]
   \[
   v_T = v_T
   \]

4. Absolute value constraint (introducing auxiliary variables \( u_t \) to represent the absolute value of \( a_t \)):
   \[
   u_t \geq a_t, \quad u_t \geq -a_t \quad \text{for } t = 0, \ldots, T-1
   \]

######### Linear Programming Formulation:

\begin{document}

\textbf{Linear Programming Model:} 

\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize} \quad & \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} u_t \\
\text{subject to} \quad & x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t, \quad t = 0, \ldots, T-1 \\
& v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t, \quad t = 0, \ldots, T-1 \\
& x_1 = x_0 + v_0 \\
& v_1 = v_0 + a_0 \\
& x_T = x_T \\
& v_T = v_T \\
& u_t \geq a_t, \quad u_t \geq -a_t, \quad t = 0, \ldots, T-1
\end{align*}

\end{document}
```

This LP model minimizes the fuel consumption (sum of accelerations) while ensuring that the rocket follows the laws of motion, satisfies initial and target conditions, and bounds the absolute values of accelerations using auxiliary variables. The solution will provide the sequence of positions (\( x_t \)), velocities (\( v_t \)), and accelerations (\( a_t \)) at each time step, along with the total fuel spent.
