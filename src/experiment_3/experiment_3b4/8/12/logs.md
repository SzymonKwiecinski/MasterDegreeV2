PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Suppose that there are \var{N} available currencies, and assume that one unit of currency \var{i} can be exchanged for \var{rate_{i,j}} units of currency \var{j} (Naturally, we assume that \var{rate_{i,j}} > 0).
- There are also certain regulations that impose a limit \var{limit_i} on the total amount of currency \var{i} that can be exchanged (whether to other currencies or from other currencies) on any given day.
- Suppose that we start the day with \var{start_i} units of currency \var{i}
- Provide a linear programming formulation of this problem. Assume that for any sequence \var{i_1}, â€¦ ,\var{i_k} of currencies, we have \var{rate_{i_1,i_2}}, \var{rate_{i_2,i_3}}, ..., \var{rate_{i_{k-1}, i_{k}}, \var{rate_{i_k, i_1}} <= 1, which means that wealth cannot be multiplied by going through a cycle of currencies.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "start": [start_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "limit": [limit_i for i in 1, ..., N],
    "rate": [[rate_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., N] for i in 1, ..., N],
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to maximize the number of units of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day, through a sequence of currency transactions.

OUTPUT INFO: 

- The output json file contains a list of transactions, where each transaction is a json object with the following fields:
    - from: the currency that we are exchanging from
    - to: the currency that we are exchanging to
    - amount: the amount of currency that we are exchanging
- The output json file also contains the final amount of currency \var{N} that we end up with at the end of the day.

OUTPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": i,
            "to": j,
            "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }
    ],
    "final_amount_of_currency_N": final_amount_of_currency_N

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model the given currency exchange problem, we will create a Linear Programming formulation focusing on maximizing the final amount of currency \(N\) that we obtain by the end of the day, taking into account the initial amounts, exchange rates, and limits on currency exchanges. 

Let \(x_{i,j}\) represent the amount of currency \(i\) that is exchanged into currency \(j\). The objective and constraints can be set as follows:

\section*{Linear Programming Formulation}

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \(N\) be the number of available currencies.
    \item \( \text{start}_i \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, N \) is the starting amount of currency \(i\).
    \item \( \text{limit}_i \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, N \) is the limit on the total amount of currency \(i\) that can be exchanged.
    \item \( \text{rate}_{i,j} \) for \( i, j = 1, \ldots, N \) is the exchange rate from currency \(i\) to currency \(j\).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( x_{i,j} \geq 0 \): amount of currency \(i\) exchanged to currency \(j\).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Maximize the final amount of currency \(N\):
\[
\max \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{rate}_{i,N} \cdot x_{i,N}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{align*}
    & \text{Exchange Limits: } \\
    & \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{i,j} \leq \text{limit}_i, & \forall i = 1, \ldots, N \\
    & \text{Initial Availability: } \\
    & \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{j,i} \leq \text{start}_i, & \forall i = 1, \ldots, N \\
    & \text{Non-Negativity: } \\
    & x_{i,j} \geq 0, & \forall i, j = 1, \ldots, N
\end{align*}

\end{document}
```

######### Explanation:
- **Objective Function**: We aim to maximize the total amount of currency \(N\) by summing the converted amounts from all other currencies to currency \(N\).
- **Constraints**:
  - The **exchange limits** ensure that no more than the allowed amount \(\text{limit}_i\) of any currency \(i\) is exchanged.
  - The **initial availability** constraints ensure that the total amount exchanged from a currency does not exceed what we have available initially.
  - **Non-negativity** constraints ensure that exchange amounts are not negative.

This mathematical model can be solved using Linear Programming solvers to find the optimal sequence of currency exchanges. The output will provide the list of transactions and the final amount of currency \(N\).
