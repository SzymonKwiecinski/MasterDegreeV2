PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A traveler based in \var{start_city} needs to visit \var{N} towns for business.
- The distance \var{distance_{i,j}} between city \var{i} and \var{j} is provided in miles and are symmetric, meaning the distance from city \var{i} to city \var{j} is the same as from city \var{j} to city \var{i}.
- The traveler must return to \var{start_city} after visiting all towns.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "distances": {
        city_i: {
            city_j: distance_{i, j},
            for j in 1, ..., N-1
        },
        for i in 1, ..., N
    },
    "start_city": start_city
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the shortest route that the traveler can take to visit all \var{N} towns and return to \var{start_city}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- The sequence of cities visited after \var{start_city} is \var{visit_order}.
- \var{total_distance} traveled on this optimal journey.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "visit_order": [city_n for n in 1, ..., N+1],
    "total_distance": total_distance

\section*{Mathematical Model for the Traveling Salesman Problem}

\subsection*{Given:}
- A set of cities \( C = \{1, 2, \ldots, N\} \)
- Distances \( d_{i,j} \) for \( i, j \in C \) (with \( d_{i,j} = d_{j,i} \))
- A start city \( s \in C \)

\subsection*{Decision Variables:}
- \( x_{i,j} \): Binary variable that equals 1 if the route goes directly from city \( i \) to city \( j \), 0 otherwise.
- \( u_i \): A continuous variable that helps in eliminating sub-tours, representing the order in which the cities are visited.

\subsection*{Objective:}
Minimize the total travel distance:

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1, j \neq i}^{N} d_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j}
\]

\subsection*{Constraints:}

1. **Visit each city once:**

\[
\sum_{j=1, j \neq i}^{N} x_{i,j} = 1 \quad \forall i \in C
\]

2. **Each city is left:**

\[
\sum_{i=1, i \neq j}^{N} x_{i,j} = 1 \quad \forall j \in C
\]

3. **Sub-tour elimination constraints:**

\[
u_i - u_j + N \cdot x_{i,j} \leq N-1 \quad \forall i, j \in \{2, \ldots, N\}, i \neq j
\]

4. **Returning to the starting city:**

\[
\sum_{j=1, j \neq s}^{N} x_{s,j} = 1
\]
\[
\sum_{i=1, i \neq s}^{N} x_{i,s} = 1
\]

5. **Variable domains:**

\[
x_{i,j} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall i, j \in C, i \neq j
\]
\[
u_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i \in C
\]

\subsection*{Solution:}
The solution provides the sequence of cities that minimize the total travel distance starting and ending at the start city, along with the total distance traveled.

\end{document}
```

This MILP model ensures that each city is visited exactly once, minimizes the total travel distance, and incorporates constraints to prevent sub-tours, while ensuring the traveler returns to the starting city. The model uses binary decision variables \( x_{i,j} \) to denote whether a direct path between cities \( i \) and \( j \) is chosen, and continuous variables \( u_i \) for ensuring the correct sequencing of visits.
