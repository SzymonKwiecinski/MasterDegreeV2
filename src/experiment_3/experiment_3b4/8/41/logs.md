PROBLEM TYPE: MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- Before going on vacation you want to make floppy disk backups of important files. 
- You have at your disposal several blank floppy disks with capacities of \var{capacity} GB. 
- They are given the size of the files that you want to save.
- Each file \var{j} has size \var{size_{j}}.
- Assuming that you do not have any programs to compress the data and that you have enough floppy disks available for back up everything.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"capacity": capacity,
	"size": [size_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

OBJECTIVE: How to distribute these files on the floppy disks in order to minimize the number of floppy disks used.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{n_disks} represents the total number of floppy disks used
- \var{whichdisk} represents on which disk each file is distributed. Its length is determined by \var{n_disks}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"n_disks": n_disks,
	"whichdisk": [disk_{j} for j in 1,...,N]
}

To solve the problem of distributing files on floppy disks while minimizing the number of disks used, we can model it as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. Here's the mathematical formulation in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amsthm}

\begin{document}

\section*{MILP Formulation for Disk Usage Minimization Problem}

\subsection*{Parameters:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $C$ be the capacity of each floppy disk (in GB).
    \item Let $N$ be the number of files.
    \item Let $s_j$ be the size of file $j$ for $j = 1, \ldots, N$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision Variables:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}$: A binary variable that equals 1 if file $j$ is assigned to disk $i$, and 0 otherwise.
    \item $y_i \in \{0, 1\}$: A binary variable that equals 1 if disk $i$ is used, and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objective Function:}

Minimize the number of disks used:
\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{i=1}^{M} y_i
\]
where $M$ is the maximum number of disks that might be used, initially assumed to be equal to $N$.

\subsection*{Constraints:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each file must be on exactly one disk:
    \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{M} x_{ij} = 1, \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots, N
    \]

    \item The total size of files on each disk cannot exceed its capacity:
    \[
    \sum_{j=1}^{N} s_j \cdot x_{ij} \leq C \cdot y_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M
    \]

    \item A disk is considered used if any file is assigned to it:
    \[
    x_{ij} \leq y_i, \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, M, \; j = 1, \ldots, N
    \]
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution Variables:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $n\_disks$: The total number of disks used.
    \item $whichdisk$: An array where the $j^{th}$ element indicates the disk to which file $j$ is assigned.
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
```

This model will allow you to find the minimum number of disks required to store all the files given their sizes and the capacity of each disk. The constraints ensure that each file is assigned to exactly one disk and that no disk's capacity is exceeded.
