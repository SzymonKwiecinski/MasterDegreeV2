PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- A company produces and sells \var{P} different products. 
- The demand for each product is unlimited, but the company is constrained by cash availability and machine capacity.
- Each unit of the \var{i}-th product requires \var{hour_i} machine hours.
- There are \var{availableHours} machine hours available in the current production period.
- The production costs are \var{cost_i} per unit of the \var{i}-th product.
- The selling prices of the \var{i}-th product is \var{price_i} per unit.
- The available cash is \var{cash}.
- Furthermore, \var{investRate_i} of the sales revenues from the \var{i}-th product will be made available to finance operations during the current period.
- \var{investPercentage_i} is a number between 0 and 1
- The company could increase its available machine hours by \var{upgradeHours}, after spending \var{upgradeCost} for certain repairs. 
- The net income from each product is the revenue we get from selling it minus the production cost and the investment cost.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
    "cash": cash,
    "hour": [hour_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "cost": [cost_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "price": [price_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "investPercentage": [investPercentage_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "upgradeHours": upgradeHours,   
    "upgradeCost": upgradeCost,
    "availableHours": availableHours,
}

OBJECTIVE: We are aiming at maximizing total net income subject to the cash availability and machine capacity limitations

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{net_income} shows the net income of the company
- \var{production_i} shows the production quantity of the \var{i}-th product
- \var{upgrade} is a boolean variable that shows whether the company should upgrade its machine capacity or not

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "net_income": net_income,
    "production": [production_i for i in 1, ..., P],
    "upgrade": true/false,
}

To model this problem as a linear programming (LP) problem, we need to define the decision variables, the objective function, and the constraints based on the given problem information. Here is the LP model in LaTeX format:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\section*{Linear Programming Model}

\subsection*{Decision Variables}
\begin{align*}
x_i & : \text{Number of units produced of product } i, \; i = 1, \ldots, P \\
y & : \text{Binary variable indicating whether to upgrade machine capacity (1 if upgrade, 0 otherwise)}
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Objective Function}
Maximize the total net income:
\begin{align*}
\text{Maximize } & \sum_{i=1}^{P} \left( \text{price}_i \times x_i - \text{cost}_i \times x_i - \text{investPercentage}_i \times \text{price}_i \times x_i \right) - \text{upgradeCost} \times y
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Constraints}
\begin{align*}
\text{Cash Constraint: } & \sum_{i=1}^{P} \text{cost}_i \times x_i \leq \text{cash} + \sum_{i=1}^{P} \text{investPercentage}_i \times \text{price}_i \times x_i \\
\text{Machine Hour Constraint: } & \sum_{i=1}^{P} \text{hour}_i \times x_i \leq \text{availableHours} + \text{upgradeHours} \times y \\
\text{Upgrade Binary Constraint: } & y \in \{0, 1\} \\
\text{Non-negativity: } & x_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots, P
\end{align*}

\end{document}
```

This linear programming model includes:
- Decision variables \(x_i\) for the production quantity of each product and a binary decision variable \(y\) for upgrading machine capacity.
- An objective function that maximizes the net income by considering revenue, production costs, and potential upgrade costs.
- Constraints to ensure cash availability and machine capacity are not exceeded, while also considering the potential upgrade.

This model can be solved using a suitable LP solver to find the optimal production quantities and determine whether upgrading machine capacity is beneficial.
