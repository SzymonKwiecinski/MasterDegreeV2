PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO: 

- Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. 
- Let \var{x_t}, \var{v_t}, and \var{a_t} be the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at time \var{t}.
- By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form 
    
    \var{x_{t+1}} = \var{x_t} + \var{v_t}
    \var{v_{t+1}} = \var{v_t} + \var{a_t}

- We assume that the acceleration \var{a_t} is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust.
- In a rough model, the magnitude |\var{a_t}| of the acceleraÂ­tion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at time \var{t}.
- Suppose that we have \var{x_0} and \var{v_0} as the initial position and velocity, respectively, of the rocket.
- We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position \var{x_T} with speed \var{v_T} at time \var{T}.
- Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this in an economical fashion, that is, by using as little fuel as possible.


INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "x_0": x_0,
    "v_0": v_0,
    "x_T": x_T,
    "v_T": v_T,
    "T": T
}

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to minimize the maximum thrust required, which is max_t |a_t|. 

OUTPUT INFO:

- key "x" contains a list of the positions of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "v" contains a list of the velocities of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "a" contains a list of the accelerations of the rocket at each time step from 0 to \var{T}
- key "fuel_spend" contains the total fuel spent by the rocket

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "x": [x_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "v": [v_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "a": [a_i for i in 1, ..., T],
    "fuel_spend": fuel_spent,

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To model this problem as a Linear Programming (LP) problem, we need to define the decision variables, the objective function, and the constraints. The decision variables are the accelerations \( a_t \) for \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \), and the positions \( x_t \) and velocities \( v_t \) for \( t = 1, \ldots, T \). 

We aim to minimize the maximum magnitude of acceleration, which translates to minimizing the maximum thrust required \(\text{max}_t |a_t|\). The total fuel spent is the sum of the absolute values of the accelerations over all time periods.

Here is how you can formulate the problem in LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Objective:}
\[
\min \max_{t=0, \ldots, T-1} |a_t|
\]

\textbf{Subject to:}
\begin{align*}
x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
v_{t+1} &= v_t + a_t, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1 \\
x_0 &= x_0 \quad \text{(Given)} \\
v_0 &= v_0 \quad \text{(Given)} \\
x_T &= x_T \quad \text{(Target position)} \\
v_T &= v_T \quad \text{(Target velocity)} \\
|a_t| &\leq M, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1
\end{align*}

\textbf{Where:}
\begin{align*}
x_t &: \text{position of the rocket at time } t \\
v_t &: \text{velocity of the rocket at time } t \\
a_t &: \text{acceleration (control variable) at time } t \\
M &: \text{maximum allowable thrust (fuel consumption)} \\
\end{align*}

\textbf{Fuel Consumption:}
\[
\text{Fuel Spend} = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} |a_t|
\]

\end{document}
```

In this formulation:
- The objective function is minimizing the maximum thrust required.
- The constraints include the dynamic equations for position and velocity, the initial conditions, and the final conditions.
- We use \( M \) as the variable for the maximum absolute value of the accelerations, which is the thrust to minimize.
- Finally, the total fuel spent is calculated as the sum of absolute accelerations.
