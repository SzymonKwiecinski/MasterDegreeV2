PROBLEM TYPE: LP or MILP
PROBLEM INFO:

- To operate a cafeteria, the manager must ensure on-call duty based on the statistics on the required staff. 
- In the future days, the number of desired employees on day \var{n} is denoted with \var{num_{n}}.
- Each employee works \var{n_working_days} days in a row and then has \var{n_resting_days} days off.

INPUT FORMAT:

{
	"num": [num_{n} for n in 1,...,N],
	"n_working_days": n_working_days,
	"n_resting_days": n_resting_days
}


OBJECTIVE: Calculate the minimum number of employees to hire

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{total_number} represents the total number of employees to employ
- \var{is_work} represents whether employee is working a rest on each day. Its length is determined by \var{total_number}

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
	"total_number": total_number,
	"is_work": [[is_work_{n, i} for n in 1,...,N] for i in 1,...,total_number]

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of employees required to satisfy the working schedule over a given period while ensuring each employee works and rests according to the specified number of days.

The problem can be formulated as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. Here's the mathematical formulation:

Let:
- \( N \) be the total number of days.
- \( \text{num}[n] \) be the number of employees needed on day \( n \).
- \( n_{\text{working}} \) be the number of consecutive working days for each employee.
- \( n_{\text{resting}} \) be the number of consecutive resting days for each employee.
- \( M \) be a sufficiently large number to allow flexibility in constraints (can initially be set to the sum of all employee needs).

Define the decision variables:
- \( x_i \) where \( x_i = 1 \) if employee \( i \) is hired, otherwise \( 0 \).
- \( \text{is\_work}[n, i] \) where \( \text{is\_work}[n, i] = 1 \) if employee \( i \) is working on day \( n \), otherwise \( 0 \).

Objective:
Minimize the total number of employees hired:
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{M} x_i
\]

Constraints:
1. Ensure the required number of employees is working each day:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{M} \text{is\_work}[n, i] \geq \text{num}[n], \quad \forall n = 1, \ldots, N
\]

2. Define the working and resting schedule for each employee:
\[
\text{is\_work}[n, i] \leq x_i, \quad \forall n = 1, \ldots, N, \; i = 1, \ldots, M
\]
\[
\text{is\_work}[n, i] = 1 \implies \text{is\_work}[n+1, i] = 1, \ldots, \text{is\_work}[n+n_{\text{working}}-1, i] = 1
\]
\[
\text{is\_work}[n+n_{\text{working}}, i] = 0, \ldots, \text{is\_work}[n+n_{\text{working}}+n_{\text{resting}}-1, i] = 0 
\]
   - These constraints ensure that an employee \( i \) works \( n_{\text{working}} \) consecutive days followed by \( n_{\text{resting}} \) days off.

Below is the MILP model expressed in LaTeX:

\textbf{Objective:} \\
Minimize the total number of employees: 
\[
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{M} x_i
\]

\textbf{Subject to:} \\
1. Daily staffing requirements:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{M} \text{is\_work}[n, i] \geq \text{num}[n], \quad \forall n = 1, \ldots, N
\]

2. Employee working schedule constraints:
\[
\text{is\_work}[n, i] \leq x_i, \quad \forall n = 1, \ldots, N, \; i = 1, \ldots, M
\]

\[
\text{is\_work}[n, i] = 1 \implies \text{is\_work}[n+1, i] = 1, \ldots, \text{is\_work}[n+n_{\text{working}}-1, i] = 1
\]

\[
\text{is\_work}[n+n_{\text{working}}, i] = 0, \ldots, \text{is\_work}[n+n_{\text{working}}+n_{\text{resting}}-1, i] = 0
\]

\textbf{Variables:} \\
- \( x_i \in \{0, 1\} \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, M \)
- \( \text{is\_work}[n, i] \in \{0, 1\} \) for \( n = 1, \ldots, N, \; i = 1, \ldots, M \)

Note: Given the nature of the problem, implementing logical implications as constraints may require additional binary variables or specific solver capabilities. The constraints provided above are a conceptual representation and may need adaptation based on the solver being used.
