PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes.
- Consider a transportation network consisting of \var{n} cities.
- Soybeans are sent from a terminal city \var{k} to a port city \var{p}.
- Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city \var{p} to a destination city \var{l}
- Let \var{A} be the set of all routes. 
- There is a positive transport cost \var{C_{i,j}} per metric ton along that route.
- Each source terminal \var{k} has a soybean supply of \var{supply_{k}}. 
- Each destination \var{l} has a demand for soybeans of \var{demand_{l}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "routes": [
       {
        "start": i,
        "end": j,
        "C": C_{i,j},
       }
    ],
    "demand": [
        {
            "destination": l,
            "D": demand_{l}
        }
    ],
    "supply": [
        {
            "terminal": k,
            "S": supply_{k}
        }
    ]
}

OBJECTIVE: What quantity of soybeans should they from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the amount of soybeans shipped from \var{i} to \var{j} is \var{amount_{i,j}}.
- \var{total_cost} represents the total transportation cost.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "distribution": [
        {"from": i,
         "to": j,
         "amount": amount_{i,j}
        }

    ],
    "total_cost": total_cost

### ROLE: Role.ASSISTANT
To formulate this transportation problem as a Linear Programming (LP) model, we'll define the decision variables, the objective function, and the constraints using the given problem information:

**Decision Variables:**
- Let \( x_{i,j} \) be the amount of soybeans transported from city \( i \) to city \( j \).

**Objective Function:**
- Minimize the total transportation cost:
  \[
  \text{Minimize } \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j}
  \]

**Constraints:**
1. **Supply Constraints:**
   - For each source terminal city \( k \):
     \[
     \sum_{j \mid (k,j) \in A} x_{k,j} \leq \text{supply}_k
     \]

2. **Demand Constraints:**
   - For each destination city \( l \):
     \[
     \sum_{i \mid (i,l) \in A} x_{i,l} \geq \text{demand}_l
     \]

3. **Flow Conservation Constraints:**
   - For each intermediate city (not a source or a destination):
     \[
     \sum_{i \mid (i,j) \in A} x_{i,j} = \sum_{j \mid (j,i) \in A} x_{j,i}
     \]

4. **Non-negativity:**
   - \( x_{i,j} \geq 0 \) for all \((i,j) \in A\).

Here's the LaTeX formulation for the described problem:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\textbf{Transportation Problem Formulation}

\textit{Decision Variables:}
\[
x_{i,j} = \text{amount of soybeans shipped from city } i \text{ to city } j
\]

\textit{Objective Function:}
\[
\text{Minimize } \sum_{(i,j) \in A} C_{i,j} \cdot x_{i,j}
\]

\textit{Subject to:}

\textit{1. Supply Constraints:}
\[
\forall k, \quad \sum_{j \mid (k,j) \in A} x_{k,j} \leq \text{supply}_k
\]

\textit{2. Demand Constraints:}
\[
\forall l, \quad \sum_{i \mid (i,l) \in A} x_{i,l} \geq \text{demand}_l
\]

\textit{3. Flow Conservation Constraints:}
\[
\forall j \text{ (intermediate city)}, \quad 
\sum_{i \mid (i,j) \in A} x_{i,j} = \sum_{k \mid (j,k) \in A} x_{j,k}
\]

\textit{4. Non-negativity:}
\[
x_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \forall (i,j) \in A
\]

\end{document}
```

This model will help determine the optimal amount of soybeans to ship along each route in order to satisfy all demands while minimizing the transportation cost.
